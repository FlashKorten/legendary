"Bite your tongue! They used to eat cake, and eggs, and honey, until you came and ripped their throats out.\n - Drusilla\n\n",
"Blonde. Short. Strong for a human... and massively rude! Broke my shoe, took my monk. Do you have any idea who I'm talking about?\n - Glorificus\n\n",

"Boy, of all the humiliations you've had I've witnessed, that was the latest\n - Cordelia\n\n",

"Buffy, these men are rich, and I am not being shallow. Think of all the poor people I could help with all my money.\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Buffy, this is all about fear. It's understandable, but you can't let it control you. 'Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to anger.' No wait, hold on. 'Fear leads to hate. Hate leads to the dark side.' Hold on, no, umm, 'First you get the women, then you get the money, then you...' Okay, can we forget that?\n - Xander\n\n",
"Buffy, what you said, it flies in the face of everything we've ever... every generation has ever done in the fight against evil. I think it's bloody brilliant\n - Giles\n\n",
"Buffy, you can't blame yourself for every death that happens in Sunnydale. If it weren't for you people'd be lined up five deep waitin'to get themselves buried. Willow would be Robbie the Robot's love slave, I wouldn't even have a head, and Theresa's a vampire.\n - Willow\n\n",

"Bunnies! Floppy, hoppy... bunnies\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"But I couldn't look at you. I mean, it turns out, the one thing that brings it out of me is you. Which falls under the heading of ironic in my book\n - Oz\n\n",
"But does he have to leave the country? I mean, you got fired and you still hang around like a big loser. Why can't he?\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"But maybe, we could spend some time together soon? Some night when I'm not being held hostage by a raving psychotic\n - Joyce\n\n",
"But on the other hand, heck, maybe we won. And right now, I'm on some jumbo monitor in the Richard Wilkins Museum, surrounded by a bunch of kids sitting Indian-style and looking up at my face, filled with fear and wonder. Hi, kids!\n - Mayor Wilkins\n\n",
"But sexual interc-- What you're talking about, well--and I'm actually turning into a woman as I say this--but it's about expressing something. And accepting consequences\n - Xander\n\n",
"But we know the world didn't end, 'cause... check it out.\n - Oz\n\n",
"But you like him, and when you think about him, you get that good down-low tickle, right?\n - Faith\n\n",
"But, you should have seen him lying there, all black and blue. How's he gonna' look in our prom pictures? How am I ever gonna' be able to show them to anyone?\n - Cordelia\n\n",

"Come on, I can feel it, Slayer. You know you want to dance\n - Spike\n\n",
"Come on, Slayer, I like it when you're scared. The more I scare you, the better you smell.\n - Xander\n\n",
"Come on, you've been dating for what, like 200 years? You don't know what a girl means when she says maybe she'll show\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Comfy? I'm chained in a bathtub, drinking pigs blood from a novelty mug. Doesn't rate huge in the Zagat's guide\n - Spike\n\n",
"Competition. Competition is a beautiful thing. It makes us strive, it makes us accomplish, occasionally makes us kill. We all have the desire to win. Whether we're human, vampire... Whatever the hell you are, my brother, you got a spiny-looking head thing, I never seen that before\n - Mr. Trick\n\n",
"Congratulations to the Class of 1999. You all proved more or less adequate\n - Principal Snyder\n\n",
"Congratulations, you've found me out. I'm a mod jogger.\n - Giles\n\n",
"Cool.' Look it up. It's something that a subliterate that's repeated 12th grade three times has and you don't. There was no part of that that wasn't fun\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Cordelia, your mouth is open, sound is coming from it. This is never good.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Creature of the night here, yeah? Some people forget that.\n - Spike\n\n",
"Curiosity. Woman's first sin. I offer her an apple, what can she do but take it?\n - Caleb\n\n",
"Damn it! You know what? I'm sick of this crap. I'm sick of being the guy who eats insects, and gets the funny syphilis. As of this moment, it's over. I'm finished being everybody's butt-monkey\n - Xander\n\n",
"Damn it, Xander, what's going on? Who died and made you Elvis?\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Dark hair, this tall, name of Faith. Criminally insane. I like this girl already\n - Spike\n\n",
"Darn your sinister attraction.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Dawn's a total klepto ... money's been so tight that I've been slinging burgers at the Doublemeat Palace... And I've been sleeping with Spike\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Death is on your heels, baby. And sooner or later, it's gonna catch you. And part of you wants it. Not only to stop the fear and uncertainty, but because you're just a little bit in love with it.\n - Spike\n\n",
"Death is what a slayer breathes, what a slayer dreams about when she sleeps\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Delivering melted cheese on bread, doing your part to keep America constipated.\n - Spike\n\n",
"Demons after money? Whatever happened to the still beating heart of a virgin. No one has any standards any more\n - Giles\n\n",
"Demons cling to old ways and ancient feuds. And they're hopeless with technology; unworthy\n - Adam\n\n",

"Do you think there are going to be questions about her sex life on the test? 'Cause I really hope I don't have to study all that\n - Amanda\n\n",
"Does that mean I have to be a bigger, badder badass than the source of all badness\n - Willow\n\n",
"Don't be ridiculous. Martha Stewart isn't a demon. She's a witch. Nobody could do that much decoupage without calling on the powers of darkness.\n - Anyanka\n\n",

"Dru bagged a Slayer? She didn't tell me. Good for her... Though not from your perspective, I suppose.\n - Spike\n\n",

"Evil! You're all evil again\n - Willow\n\n",

"Exactly. Riley seems so solid. Like... he wouldn't cause me heartache\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Excuse me? Who, at a crucial moment, distracted the lead demon by allowing her to pummel him about the head?\n - Xander\n\n",
"Face it, white bread, Buffy's got a type, and you're not it. She likes us dangerous, rough, occasionally bumpy in the forehead region. Not that she doesn't like you, but sorry, Charlie, you're just not dark enough\n - Spike\n\n",
"Faith has taken my body, and for all I know, she's taken it to Mexico by now. I don't have time for bondage fun\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Faith: her name alone invokes awe. Faith: a set of principles or beliefs upon which you're willing to devote your life. The dark Slayer. A lethal combination of beauty, power, and death. For years and years, or to be more accurate, months, Faith fought on the side of good, terrorizing the evil community. But like so many tragic heroes, Faith was seduced by the lure of the dark side. She wrapped evil around her like a large evil Mexican serape. She became a cold-blooded killer. Nobody was immune to her trail of destruction -- not friends, not family, not even the most pacifist and logical of races...\n - Andrew\n\n",
"Fe, fi, fo, fum. I smell the blood of a nice ripe girl.\n - Spike\n\n",
"Finally decided to tie me up, huh? I always knew you weren't really a one-Slayer guy\n - Faith\n\n",
"Fine, go. Leave me here to stew in my impotent rage. All right, well, I'm also gonna pee, so you should probably go\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"Fine. You know what? I hope you die. Aren't we gonna kiss?\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"First word, 'jail,' second word, 'bait\n - Faith\n\n",
"Five-by-five? Five what by five what?\n - Tara\n\n",
"For a thousand years I wielded the powers of the Wish. I brought ruin to the heads of unfaithful men. I brought forth destruction and chaos for the pleasure of the lower beings. I was feared and worshipped across the mortal globe. And now I'm stuck at Sunnydale High. Mortal. Child. And I'm flunking Math\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"For god's sake, man, she's 18! And you have the emotional maturity of a blueberry scone. Just have at it, would you? And stop fluttering about\n - Giles\n\n",
"For what? For Angel to go psycho again the next time you give him a happy?\n - Xander\n\n",
"Forgive me, shiny special one, I beg of you to rip out my inadequate tongue\n - Glory's Minions\n\n",
"From beneath you, it devours\n - Willow\n\n",
"Funny thing about vampires, Faith. We don't establish meaningful dialogue with Slayers.\n - Angel\n\n",
"Funny you should ask. (grabs Buffy) Lesson the first: A Slayer must always reach for her weapon. I've already got mine\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Funny. ‘Cause I look around at this world you’re so eager to be a part of, and all I see is six billion lunatics looking for the fastest ride out. Who’s not crazy? Look around. Everyone’s drinking, smoking, shooting up, shooting each other, or just plain screwing their brains out ‘cause they don’t want ‘em anymore. I’m crazy? Honey, I’m the original one-eyed chicklet in the kingdom of the blind. ‘Cause at least I admit the world makes me nuts.\n - Glorificus\n\n",
"Gee, Xander, and what are you gonna' to teach when you fail in life? Advanced loser being?\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Gee, Xander, maybe you should learn a second language so that even more girls can reject you.\n - Harmony\n\n",
"Gee, Xander, what are you gonna teach when you fail in life? Advanced loser-being?\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Gee, if doing violence to vampires upsets you, I think you're in the wrong line of work.\n - Faith\n\n",
"Generally speaking, when scary things get scared - not good.\n - Xander\n\n",
"Getting killed made me feel alive for the very first time\n - Spike\n\n",
"Giles didn't set this up. Angel did. This is the wrapping for the gift.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Giles! I accidentally killed Spike! That's okay, right?\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Giles, care? I'm putting my life on the line, battling the undead. Look, I broke a nail, ok? I'm wearing a press-on. The least you could do is exhibit some casual interest; you can go hmm.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Giles, there are two things that I don't believe in: coincidence and leprechauns.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"God, I could eat a horse. Isn't it crazy how slayin'just always makes you hungry and horny\n - Faith\n\n",
"God, Xander, is that all you think about?\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Good dogs don't bite.\n - Angel\n\n",
"Good-bye, Dru. See you in hell\n - Spike\n\n",
"Good. Of course, once you're down there, I could join you. Kidding. I like my sex on top of the table\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"Good.'Cause I've had it. Spike is going down. You can attack me, you can send assassins after me, that's fine. But nobody messes with my boyfriend!\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Gosh, but I'm feeling chipper! Who's for a root-beer?\n - Mayor Wilkins\n\n",
"Got to hand it to you, Goldilocks. You do have bleeding tragic taste in men. I got a cousin married to a regurgitating Froglocsteem that's got better instincts than you\n - Spike\n\n",
"Great, I'll give Xander a call. What's his number? Oh yeah, 1-800-IM-DATING-A-SKANKY-HO\n - Willow\n\n",
"Harmony has minions?\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Harmony's a vampire? She must be dying without a reflection\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Harmony, when you tried to be head cheerleader, you were bad. When you tried to chair the Homecoming committee, you were really bad. But when you try to be bad ... you suck\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Haven't I taught you anything, Anya? Never go for the kill when you can go for the pain\n - D'Hoffryn\n\n",
"Haven't you figured it all out yet, with your enormous squishy frontal lobes?\n - Spike\n\n",
"He didn't try to slit our throats or anything. That's progress.\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"He got hit by the Buffinator. Now he's powerless.\n - Xander\n\n",
"He thinks she's sexy. He gets this blushy thing going on behind his ears. That's for me only\n - Willow\n\n",
"He's 243 years old. He doesn't exactly get the prom\n - Buffy\n\n",
"He's a wanker, but he's the only one we've got with half a brain. If he fails, you could eat his eyes out of his sockets for all I care.\n - Spike\n\n",
"He's lying. Hit him! You're my Slayer, go knock his teeth down his throat\n - Giles\n\n",
"He's perfect, my darling. Just what I wanted.\n - Drusilla\n\n",
"Heard this voodoo once turned you into the big scary. Big, scary Willow. That's something I'd almost like to see\n - Kennedy\n\n",
"Heh heh. As long as you're there, I mostly want you to wriggle...but I'm listening.\n - Angel\n\n",
"Hello! I'm back! Clean and with the better smell now\n - Xander\n\n",
"Hello, Miss Motormouth, can I get a sentence finished?\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Hello, gorgeous\n - Spike\n\n",
"Hello, ladies. Welcome to SlayerFest '98. What is a SlayerFest, you ask? Well, as in most of life, there's the hunters and the hunted. Can you guess where you two fall? From the beginning of this tape you have exactly 30 seconds -- no, that's 17 now -- to run for your lives. Faith, Buffy, have a nice death.\n - Mr. Trick\n\n",
"Hello, two years of Tae Kwon Do, and vampire strength. I think somebody's counting their chickens\n - Holden Webster\n\n",
"Hello? How stupid are you people? She's a Slayer. I'm a Homecoming Queen!\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Her. Dark hair, yea tall, name of Faith, criminally insane\n - Xander\n\n",
"Here's the good news - just because it's over for my Faith, doesn't mean she can't go out with a bang\n - Mayor Wilkins\n\n",
"Hey don't worry about it. Nest full of vampires, you come get me, okay? Box full of puppies, that's more of a judgement call.\n - Jonathan\n\n",
"Hey! Minions, I can hear you. God-like ears don't miss much, you know what I'm sayin'?\n - Glorificus\n\n",
"Hey! Remember this? I took it from Faith. Stuck it in her gut. Just slid in her like she was butter. You wanna get it back from me? Dick?\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Hey! What am I, a bleeding broken record? I'm bad. It's just... I can't bite anymore. Thanks to you wankers\n - Spike\n\n",
"Hey, I don't have a pulse. Cool! Can we eat a doctor so I can get a stethoscope and hear my heart not beating?\n - Harmony\n\n",
"Hey, I don't wanna keep you all from the touchy-feelies, but maybe the encounter group can meet later. Say, when we're not trapped in a house?\n - Spike\n\n",
"Hey, I love you. Even if you're covered with slime\n - Angel\n\n",
"Hey, I'm well aware of how lucky I am. Like, lottery lucky. Buffy's like nobody else in the world. When I'm with her, it's like... it's like I'm split in two. Half of me is just on fire, going crazy if I'm not touching her. The other half is so still and peaceful, just perfectly content... just knows: this is the one. But she doesn't love me\n - Riley\n\n",
"Hey, as long as you don't go scratchin' at me or humpin' my leg, we're five-by-five, ya' know?\n - Faith\n\n",
"Hey, can we come rocketing back to the part about me and my new syphilis?\n - Xander\n\n",
"Hey, hands off my holy man!\n - Glorificus\n\n",
"Hey, it's me. If Angel's doing something wrong, I wanna' know...'cause it gives me a happy\n - Xander\n\n",
"Hey, party in my eyesocket and everyone's invited!\n - Xander\n\n",
"Hey, the way things were going, be glad that's the worst that happened. At least I got to the two of you before you actually did something\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Hey, uh, Evil Dead, you're in my seat.\n - Xander\n\n",
"Hi Mr. Beach. Are you planning on killing a bunch of people tomorrow? Oh, it's for the yearbook\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"His physical presence has a penis!\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"Home... sweet... home\n - Spike\n\n",
"Honey, we need to talk about the invitations. Now, do you want to be 'William the Bloody' or just 'Spike'? 'Cause either way, it's gonna look majorly weird\n - Buffy\n\n",
"How about the end of the world?\n - Giles\n\n",
"How can you tell me you understand what those vampires are feeling? You aren't a passion to them, you are a snack! A willing, idiotic snack.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"How do you get to be renowned? I mean, like, do you have to be nowned first?\n - Buffy\n\n",
"How many people do you think we've saved by now, thousands? And didn't you stop the world form ending? Because in my book, that puts you and me in the plus column\n - Faith\n\n",
"Hunt and kill, hunt and kill. Titillating? Yes. Practical? Hardly. Meanwhile, the humans, with their plebeian minds, have brought us a truly demonic concept. Mass production!\n - The Master\n\n",
"I am a nice, normal guy\n - Riley\n\n",
"I am a she-witch, a very powerful she-witch - or witch, as is more accurate. I am not to be trifled with...\n - Willow\n\n",
"I am bad. I'm a bad, bad, man\n - Giles\n\n",
"I am bad. I'm bad. I'm evil. But I'm protected by powerful forces, forces you can't even begin to imagine... little girl. If you harm me you shall know the wrath of he that is darkness and terror. Your blood will boil, and you will know true suffering. Stand down, she-witch. Your defeat is at hand\n - Andrew\n\n",
"I am so back in the vengeance fold!\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"I am weary, and their deaths will bring me little joy. Of course, sometimes a little is enough\n - The Master\n\n",
"I apologize, I assumed you knew. I'm Dracula\n - Dracula\n\n",
"I aspire to help my fellow man.' Check. As long as he's not smelly, dirty, or something gross.\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"I better be. 'Cause if I get vamped, I'm gonna bite your ass\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"I brought you a snack. I thought it was about time for me to come out and watch. You know, the slaying\n - Joyce\n\n",
"I call it Mr. Pointy\n - Kendra\n\n",
"I came over here to tell Buffy to stop this craziness, and found you all unconscious--again. How many times have you been knocked out, anyway? I swear, one of these times, you're going to wake up in a coma\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"I came to meet the renowned killer\n - Dracula\n\n",
"I can kill a couple of geeks all by myself. But, hey, if you'd like to watch... I mean, that's what you Watchers are good at, right? Watching?\n - Willow\n\n",
"I can't dance\n - Riley\n\n",
"I can't stop thinking about you. Sometimes, in my dreams, you're all naked.\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"I could do anything to you now, and you'd want me to. I could make you scream. I could make you die\n - Faith\n\n",
"I could so save the world if somebody handed me super-powers. But I'd think of a cool name and wear a mask to protect my loved ones. Which Buffy doesn't even\n - Dawn\n\n",
"I couldn't believe it the first 20 times you told us, but it's starting to sink in now\n - Riley\n\n",
"I did it for you. And you keep punishing me. Carrying on with creatures like this. Chaos Demon: Okay, you guys obviously have a thing going on here...\n - Spike\n\n",
"I didn't come here to take anything away from you, but I'm not gonna be your little lapdog, either\n - Faith\n\n",
"I didn't get this job because of my looks\n - Giles\n\n",
"I didn't order any vampires\n - Xander\n\n",
"I do appreciate violence\n - Adam\n\n",
"I don't go out with vampires. Never interested in my intellect\n - Riley\n\n",
"I don't handle rejection well. Funny, considering all the practice I've had, huh?\n - Xander\n\n",
"I don't have time for vendettas. The mission is what matters\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I don't know - I was going for ferocious/scary, but it's coming out more dryly sardonic\n - Xander\n\n",
"I don't know if I can lead. But the real question is: can you follow?\n - Faith\n\n",
"I don't know nearly enough about this to risk you wearing it. Besides, you got that real cool ax-thing going for you\n - Angel\n\n",
"I don't know what's coming next. But I do know it's gonna be just like this -- hard, painful. But in the end, it's gonna be us. If we all do our parts, believe it, we'll be the ones left standing. Here endeth the lesson\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I don't know. I kinda' see Oz as the loyal type\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I don't like spiders, okay? Their furry bodies, and their sticky webs, and what do they need all those legs for anyway? I'll tell you - for crawling across your face in the middle of the night\n - Willow\n\n",
"I don't like vampires. I'm going to take a stand and say they're not good.\n - Xander\n\n",
"I don't need to say 'oh', I got it before. They slept together\n - Willow\n\n",
"I don't really know what to say. Um, I understand that this sort of thing requires ice cream of some kind\n - Giles\n\n",
"I don't think Buffy's Watcher likes me too much. I think it's 'cause he's just so... old. I'm not sure how old he is, but I heard him use the word 'newfangled' one time, so he's got to be pretty far gone\n - Dawn\n\n",
"I don't think you wanna help. I think you just wanna slay the demon, then go 'La, la, la'\n - Willow\n\n",
"I don't wanna' get all twelve-steppy, but remember when you told me that killing people would make me feel like some kind of god? I think I just came down to Earth.\n - Faith\n\n",
"I don't want any trouble. I just want to be alone and quiet in a room with a chair and a fireplace and a tea cozy. I don't even know what a tea cozy is, but I want one.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I don't want danger. Big'no'to danger\n - Willow\n\n",
"I doubt he'd remember me. I was just a silly young thing. I mean, like 700 or so. But he did say that this guy I cursed was doomed forever, which was really sweet, don't you think?\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"I doubt your doubt. Everyone knows that witches killed those kids, and Amy is a witch. And Michael is whatever the boy of witch is, plus being the poster child for yuch. If you're going to hang with them, expect badness. 'Cause that's what you get when you hang with freaks and losers. Believe me, I know. That was a pointed comment about me hanging with you guys\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"I fed on a girl your age. Beautiful. Dumb as a post\n - Angel\n\n",
"I fell in love with a beautiful vampire girl down in Mexico and now we're trying to make a go of it on the straight and narrow and put our lives back together here in Sunnydale\n - Andrew\n\n",
"I figured I'd be hearing from you soon. The flaying of Warren Meers? Oh, truly inspired. That was water-cooler vengeance. Lloyd has a sketch of it on his wall\n - D'Hoffryn\n\n",
"I find one of your friends first, I'm gonna' suck him dry...and use their bones to bash your head in. Are you getting a word picture here?\n - Spike\n\n",
"I gave her everything - beautiful jewels, beautiful dresses, with beautiful girls in them, but nothing made her happy. And she would flirt! I caught her on a park bench, making out with a chaos demon! Have you ever seen a chaos demon? They're all slime and antlers. They're disgusting. She only did it to hurt me. So I said, 'I'm not putting up with this any more.' And she said, 'Fine!' And I said, 'Yeah, I've got an unlife, you know!' And then she said... she said we could still be friends. God, I'm so unhappy!\n - Spike\n\n",
"I get why all the demons all fall in line with you. You're like Tony Robbins. If he was a big, scary, Frankenstein-looking... You're exactly like Tony Robbins\n - Spike\n\n",
"I got older.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I grovel like a bug, most silky and effervescent Glorificus-- Glory! Glory, your most fresh and clean-ness, it's just a matter of time\n - Glory's Minions\n\n",
"I guess I just realized how amazingly screwed up they all are. I mean really, really screwed up, in a monumental fashion. And they have no purpose that unites them so they just drift around, blundering through life until they die... which they... they know is coming, yet every single one of them is surprised when it happens to them. They're incapable of thinking about what they want beyond the moment. They kill each other, which is clearly insane. And yet, here's the thing -- when it's something that really matters, they fight. I mean, they're lame morons for fighting, but they do. They never... never quit. So I guess I will keep fighting, too\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"I guess a guy's gotta' be undead to make time with you.\n - Xander\n\n",
"I guess that means you have a job opening\n - Faith\n\n",
"I had no idea that children en masse could be gracious\n - Giles\n\n",
"I happen to be seeking monetary gratification, yeah\n - Spike\n\n",
"I happen to be very biteable, pal. I'm moist and delicious\n - Xander\n\n",
"I hate being obvious. All fangy and 'grr!' Takes the mystery out\n - Spike\n\n",
"I hate it when they drown me.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I hate to break it to you, Oh Impotent One, but you're not 'The Big Bad' anymore. You're not even the 'Kind of Naughty\n - Xander\n\n",
"I have come to redefine the words pain and suffering since I fell in love with you\n - Spike\n\n",
"I have finesse! I have finesse coming out of my bottom! I can completely lie to the health inspector. I can, you know, distract him with coy smiles and bribe him with money and goods\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"I have grounds, I have precedent, and a tingly kind of feeling.\n - Principal Snyder\n\n",
"I have heard a few complaints over the years, but then I just killed whoever spoke up, and that was pretty much that\n - Spike\n\n",
"I have not only the right, but also a nearly physical sensation of pleasure at the thought of keeping her out of school. I'd describe myself as tingly\n - Principal Snyder\n\n",
"I have to get away from that 'bad boy' thing. There's no good there\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I have, in fact, faced two vampires myself. Under controlled circumstances, of course\n - Giles\n\n",
"I haven't been evil for a long time\n - Angel\n\n",
"I haven't processed everything yet. My brain isn't really functioning on the higher levels. It's pretty much fire bad; tree pretty\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I hear once you've tasted a Slayer, you never want to go back\n - Mr. Trick\n\n",
"I honestly feel the largest part of it was instinct. Instinct and reflexes. There's a sort of wary watchfulness I've developed over the years. It's like another sense\n - Giles\n\n",
"I just don't see why everyone's always picking on Marie Antoinette. I can so relate to her. She worked really hard to look that good, and people just don't appreciate that kind of effort. And I know the peasants were all depressed\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"I just want you to know -- this whole 'beat you to death' thing I'm doing is valuable time out of my life that I'm never going to get back\n - Glorificus\n\n",
"I knew it! I knew it! Well, not 'knew it' in the sense of having the slightest idea, but I knew there was something I didn't know! You two were fighting way too much, it's not natural\n - Willow\n\n",
"I knew you'd take this personally. You're so sensitive! How are you gonna kill her? Think! The second you even point that thing at her, you're gonna be all 'Aaagh!' And then you'll get bitch-slapped up and down Main Street, unless she's had enough and just stakes you\n - Harmony\n\n",
"I know I'm not the kind of girl vamps like to sink their teeth into. It's always like, 'Oh, you're like a sister to me,' or, 'Oh, you're such a good friend\n - Willow\n\n",
"I know she's not over the whole Riley sleeping with Faith thing. You know what I mean - Faith's insides in Buffy's outsides, when her insides were out\n - Willow\n\n",
"I know this one. Slaying entails certain sacrifices, blah, blah, biddie blah, I'm so stuffy give me a scone.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I know what you love. I have his scent on me right now\n - Veruca\n\n",
"I know what you made me do. Your promises of happy fields and dancing schnauzers and being demigods won't work on me anymore.\n - Andrew\n\n",
"I know what you're thinking, but don't worry, I don't bite!\n - Angel\n\n",
"I know you guys think it's just a big, dumb, girlie thing, but it's not. I mean, a lot of those skaters are Olympic medal winners. And every year, my Dad buys me cotton candy and one of those souvenir programs that has all the pictures-- and okay, it's a big, dumb, girlie thing, but I love it\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I know, you were too busy rushing off to die for your beloved Buffy. You'd never die for me\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"I laugh in the face of danger, and then I hide until it goes away.\n - Xander\n\n",
"I like a man with two last names. I'm Cordelia\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"I like girls I can get a grip on\n - Riley\n\n",
"I like my money the way it is... when it's mine.\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"I like to eat. I hate chicks who are like, 'Does it have dressing on it?\n - Veruca\n\n",
"I like you. You're funny, and you're nicely shaped. And frankly, it's ludicrous to have these interlocking bodies and not... interlock. Please remove your clothing now.\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"I love syphilis more than you\n - Spike\n\n",
"I love the smell of desperate librarian in the morning.\n - Principal Snyder\n\n",
"I love this job! Did you see that? I called that girl 'maggot'.\n - Kennedy\n\n",
"I love you, Willow. I love crayon breaky Willow and I love scary veiny Willow. So if you're gonna end the world, you're gonna have to start with me!\n - Xander\n\n",
"I love you. I try not to, but I can't stop\n - Angel\n\n",
"I made a mess, Giles. See, I found out that Amy's into witchcraft, and I was hurt, I guess, so I made her put the love whammy on Cordy, but it backfired. And now every woman in Sunnydale wants to make me her cuddle monkey. Which may sound swell on paper, but...\n - Xander\n\n",
"I may be dead, but I'm still pretty. Which is more than I can say for you.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I mean, I for one didn't want to start my day with a slaughter. Which really just goes to show how much I've grown!\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"I mean, don't get me wrong. I'm still a little gun-shy. It certainly didn't help that my last boyfriend turned out to be a homicidal robot\n - Joyce\n\n",
"I mean, it's not every day you find out you're...a werewolf. That's fairly freaksome.\n - Oz\n\n",
"I mean, it's not like I'm snooping around looking for proof that you're some sort of wacked out serial killer.\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"I mean, you men. It's all about the sex! You find a woman, drag her to your den, do whatever's necessary just as long as you get the sex. I tell you men haven't changed since the dawn of time\n - Willow\n\n",
"I mean, you're so smart. I always wanted to be like that\n - Harmony\n\n",
"I met an old man. Didn't like him. He got stuck in my teeth.\n - Drusilla\n\n",
"I must say, you've really got me now. I mean, this is a diabolical plan - throw yourself at my feet with a broken arm and no weapons of any kind. How am I gonna get out of this one?\n - Sunday\n\n",
"I myself would much rather be sitting at the bedside of my one-eyed ex-fiance than killing time here with you people in this over-crowded and, might I add, increasingly ripe-smelling basement\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"I need a volunteer to hit Wesley\n - Xander\n\n",
"I only wish I had my powers back. I'd liquify his entrails for her\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"I owe you pain.\n - Willow\n\n",
"I put a hex on her\n - Amy\n\n",
"I ran. I think I made it through three counties before I realized nobody was chasing me\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"I read in a magazine that some women think a man's real sex organ is his brain. Yecch. No contest. I mean, look at it. It's so... pink and wriggly-looking. Can I touch it?\n - Harmony\n\n",
"I saved the world with talking, from my mouth. My mouth saved the world\n - Xander\n\n",
"I see it, Spikey, I see the chip! It's nestled in there like a pretty little Easter egg, with your brain all around it like that green plastic grassy stuff. Only this is more of a beige...\n - Harmony\n\n",
"I see one more display of testosterone-poisoning, and I will personally put you both in the hospital\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I shot Oz!\n - Willow\n\n",
"I shouldn't take this personally. I mean, what with Angel, I mean, it's understandable that there would be transference. I mean, they're both broody immortals\n - Riley\n\n",
"I still can't believe it. We did it! We can do anything. We could stay up all night if we want to\n - Andrew\n\n",
"I swear, I would sell my soul for a decent short game. Of course, it's a little late for that. I don't suppose I could offer your soul, huh? Really help me on the green. I'm just funning\n - Mayor Wilkins\n\n",
"I tell you I have this theory? It goes where you're the one who's not my sister, 'cause Mom adopted you from a shoebox full of baby howler monkeys, and never told you 'cause it could hurt your delicate baby feelings\n - Dawn\n\n",
"I think I've actually turned into someone you want around after a crazed robot attack\n - Xander\n\n",
"I think it's the secret to getting you out of my mind. Putting you behind me. Behind me figuratively. I'm thinking face-to-face for the event itself\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"I think what my daughter's trying to say is: 'Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah!\n - Joyce\n\n",
"I think you're drawing a lot of crazy conclusions about the Unholy Prince\n - Xander\n\n",
"I think you're missing something about the whole poophead principle\n - Willow\n\n",

"I used to be a highly respected watcher, and now I'm a wounded dwarf with the mystical strength of a doily.\n - Giles\n\n",
"I wake up to find this blond chick isn't even dating the guy she was so nuts about before. I mean, she's moved on to the first college beefstick she meets. And not only has she forgotten about the love of her life, she's forgotten all about the chick she nearly killed for him. So that's my dream. That and some stuff about cigars and a tunnel\n - Faith\n\n",
"I want my room to be Willow-friendly\n - Tara\n\n",
"I want to learn from you. But I don't want to dress like you\n - Angel\n\n",
"I want to take comfort in you, and I know it will cost me my soul, and a part of me doesn’t care.\n - Angel\n\n",
"I want to torture you. I used to love it. It's been a long time. I mean, the last time I tortured somebody, they didn't even have chain saws\n - Angel\n\n",
"I was going to bleed Andrew, but you look a lot better with your shirt off\n - The First Evil\n\n",
"I was just thinking about the life of a pumpkin. Grow up in the sun, happily entwined with others, and then someone comes along, cuts you open, and rips your guts out\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I was just trying to keep up. The things you do... the way you make it hurt in all the wrong places. I've never been with such an animal.\n - Spike\n\n",
"I was thinking about looking up the guy with the bull-whip. Long incarceration\n - Faith\n\n",
"I will know your blood, Slayer. I will make your neck my chalice, and drink deep\n - Spike\n\n",
"I will make your neck my chalice... and drink deep.\n - Spike\n\n",
"I will serve you, your excellent spookiness. Or Master, I'll just stick with Master\n - Xander\n\n",
"I wish Buffy Summers had never come to Sunnydale\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"I wish all men except maybe the dumb and the really agreeable kind disappear off the face of the earth. That would be so cool!\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"I won't remind you that the fate of the world often lies with the Slayer. What would be the point? Nor shall I remind you that you've jeopardized the lives of all that you hold dear by harboring a known murderer. But sadly, I must remind you that Angel tortured me... for hours... for pleasure. You should have told me he was alive. You didn't. You have no respect for me, or the job I perform\n - Giles\n\n",
"I'd been dumped. I was miserable. Doing a few vengeance spells - boils on a penis, nothing fancy\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"I'd like your opinion. While the last thing I wish to do is model bad behavior in front of impressionable youth, I wonder if asking Miss Chase to dance-\n - Giles\n\n",
"I'd love to ice-skate at Rockefeller Center. And I'd love to see my cousins grow up and see how they turn out, 'cause they're really mean and I think they're gonna be fat\n - Cassie\n\n",
"I'll be sittin' at his right hand. Assuming he has hands after the transformation. I'm not too clear on that part. And all your little lame-ass friends are gonna' be Kibbles and Bits\n - Faith\n\n",
"I'll dance with you, pet, on the Slayer's grave.\n - Spike\n\n",
"I'll end up an old lady who can only live with cats\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I'll get Kennedy to watch the girls. She's tough. Imminent death won't bother her\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"I'll get it. It's not like I need the oxygen.\n - Angel\n\n",
"I'll give you a choice. Now, I'm going to kill you - no choice in that. But... I can let you stay dead... or bring you back, to be like me\n - Spike\n\n",
"I'm 1120 years old, just give me a frigging beer!\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"I'm Joan of Arc. I figured we had a lot in common, seeing as how I was almost burned at the stake, and plus she had that close relationship with God.\n - Willow\n\n",
"I'm Kendra...the Vampire Slayer.\n - Kendra\n\n",
"I'm a kinematically redundant, biomechanical demonoid, designed by Maggie Walsh. she called me Adam, and I called her Mother\n - Adam\n\n",
"I'm a strong, successful male who is giddy at the thought of all the women I will no doubt be dating in the near future.\n - Xander\n\n",
"I'm an ex-con who didn't finish high school\n - Faith\n\n",
"I'm beyond tired. I'm beyond scared. I'm standing on the mouth of hell, and it's going to swallow me whole. And it'll choke on me. We're not ready? They're not ready. They think we're gonna wait for the end to come, like we always do. I'm done waiting. They want an apocalypse? Oh, we'll give 'em one. Anyone else who wants to run... do it now. Because we just became an army. We just declared war. From now on we won't just face our worst fears, we will seek them out. We will find them and cut out their hearts one by one until the First shows itself for what it really is. And I'll kill it myself. There's only one thing on this earth more powerful than evil. And that's us. Any questions?\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I'm calm. You should see me when I get angry\n - Caleb\n\n",
"I'm getting better, honest. In fact, from here on, you're going to see a drastic distraction reduction. Drastic distraction reduction... try saying that ten times fast\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I'm getting the brush-off for Captain Peroxide\n - Angel\n\n",
"I'm going through some...changes\n - Oz\n\n",
"I'm going to give you all a nice, fun, normal evening, if I have to kill every single person on the face of the earth to do it\n - Buffy\n\n",

"I'm imagining having sex with him right now\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"I'm just happy to have my body back. I'm thinking of getting fat.\n - Amy\n\n",
"I'm just missing everything. I miss P.E\n - Willow\n\n",
"I'm just so excited. They come in, I help them, they give us money in exchange for goods, you give me money for working for you. I have a place in the world now. I'm part of the system. I'm a workin' gal\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"I'm just trying to tell you that we have nothing in common besides both of us liking your penis, and now I don't even have that!\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"I'm just worried this whole session's gonna turn into some training montage from an 80's movie.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I'm leaning towards blind panic myself.\n - Giles\n\n",
"I'm less worried about hitting my thumb and more worried about going all black-eyed baddie and bewitching that hammer into cracking my friends' skulls open like coconuts\n - Willow\n\n",
"I'm looking for this guy. Bleach-blond hair, leather jacket, British accent, kind of... sallow? But in a hot way?\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I'm not a demon, little girl. I am something that you can't even conceive. The first evil. Beyond sin. Beyond death. I am the thing that darkness fears. You'll never see me, but I am everywhere. Every being, every thought, every drop of hate\n - Miss Calendar\n\n",
"I'm not a kid!\n - Dawn\n\n",
"I'm not evil again. Why does everyone think that?\n - Angel\n\n",
"I'm not having these two shag while I'm tied to a chair three feet away\n - Spike\n\n",
"I'm not just some crazy person. I'm the Slayer\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I'm not saying that we should kill a teacher every day just so I can lose weight, I'm just saying when tragedy strikes, we have to look on the bright side\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"I'm not strong. I'm not an Amazon. I'm just me.\n - Willow\n\n",
"I'm not talking about the Slayer. I'm talking about Buffy. You've awakened the prom-queen within. And that crown is going to be mine\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I'm nothing like Angel\n - Spike\n\n",
"I'm only 126!\n - Spike\n\n",
"I'm over the whole 'Buffy gets one perfect high school moment' thing\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I'm pretty spry for a corpse.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I'm quite sure that a girl with the talents and abilities of Buffy will land on her feet. In fact, I noticed as I came in this morning that Hot Dog on a Stick is hiring. You will look so cute in that hat\n - Principal Snyder\n\n",
"I'm saying that Spike had a little trip to the vet, and now he doesn't chase the other puppies any more\n - Spike\n\n",
"I'm seventeen. Looking at linoleum makes me wanna have sex.\n - Xander\n\n",
"I'm sixteen years old. I don't wanna die.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I'm so very sorry. My contrition completely dwarfs the impending apocalypse\n - Giles\n\n",
"I'm sorry, Buffy, this conversation is reserved for those who actually have a future\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"I'm sorry, I didn't catch that last part on account of her neck snapping and all. Did you say the end is near... or here?\n - Caleb\n\n",
"I'm sorry, Willow. Thank you for making time in your busy life to come in here and get in the way of mine\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"I'm sorry, but let's not forget that I hated Angel long before you guys jumped on the bandwagon. So I think I deserve a little something for not saying 'I told you so' long before now. And if Giles wants to go after the, uh, fiend that murdered his girlfriend, I say, 'Faster, pussycat, kill, kill.\n - Xander\n\n",
"I'm supposed to be best man. Shouldn't I be all... Marlene Dietrich?.\n - Willow\n\n",
"I'm supposed to deliver you to the Master now. There's this whole deal where I get to be immortal. You cool with that?\n - Xander\n\n",
"I'm talking! Don't interrupt me! Insignificant man. I am Willow. I am death. If you dare defy me, I will call down my fury, exact fresh vengeance, and make your worst fears come true. Okay?\n - Willow\n\n",
"I'm telling you, I don't need a new Watcher. No offense, lady. I just have this problem with authority figures. They end up kind of dead.\n - Faith\n\n",
"I'm the one that dates dead guys. And, no offence, but they were hotties.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"I'm very into Britney Spears' early work, before she sold out. So mostly her, um, finger painting and macaroni art.\n - Dawn\n\n",
"I've always been amazed with how Buffy fought, but in a way, I feel like we took her punning for granted.\n - Xander\n\n",
"I've been awake all night. I know I'm supposed to teach you self-reliance, but I can't leave you out there to fight alone. To hell with what's right, I'm ready to back you up. Let's find the evil a-and fight it together.\n - Giles\n\n",
"I've been, uh, indexing the Watcher diaries covering the last couple of centuries. You would be amazed at how numbingly pompous and long-winded some of these Watchers were.'\n - Giles\n\n",
"I've had my share of losers, but you... you boinked the undead\n - Faith\n\n",
"I've lost my appetite for this one. She keeps looking at me. I'm trying to eat and she looks at me!\n - The Master\n\n",
"I've seen every episode of Doctor Who\n - Andrew\n\n",
"I've seen honest faces before. They usually come attached to liars\n - Willow\n\n",
"I, I'm having all sorts of... I'm dating. I, I'm having serious dating with a werewolf. And, and I'm studying witchcraft and, and killing vampires. And I didn't have anyone to talk to about all this scary life stuff.\n - Willow\n\n",
"I-I was... just thinking, wouldn't it be funny some time to see each other when it wasn't a blood thing\n - Buffy\n\n",
"If Drusilla is alive, then it would--it could be a fairly...cataclysmic state of affairs\n - Giles\n\n",
"If I could just get something for the pain. It's rather a lot of pain actually. Aspirin? Anyone? Perhaps I could just be knocked unconscious?\n - Giles\n\n",
"If I may suggest, 'This time it's personal.' I mean, there's a reason why it's a classic.\n - Oz\n\n",
"If anyone sees my spine laying around, just try not to step on it.\n - Xander\n\n",
"If every vampire who said he was at the crucifixion was actually there, it would have been like Woodstock\n - Spike\n\n",
"If it wasn't for me, Giles would be a terrified old man, staring at a quarterly tax statement and wetting himself\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"If the apocalypse comes, beep me.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"If we don't save the world, then... nothing matters\n - Amanda\n\n",
"If you save the world, I'll come back, we'll have drinks. When. When, I mean. *When* you save the world\n - Clem\n\n",
"In every generation, one slayer is born...because a bunch of men who died thousands of years ago made up that rule. They were powerful men. This woman is more powerful than all of them combined\n - Buffy\n\n",
"In fact, I am. Here to watch. Girls. Bufy and Faith, to be specific.\n - Giles\n\n",
"Interesting. Very... interesting\n - Adam\n\n",
"Is Antonio Banderas a vampire?\n - Harmony\n\n",
"Isn't it crazy how slayin' just always makes you hungry and horny?\n - Faith\n\n",
"Isn't that just like a Slayer. Solving all her problems by sticking things with sharp objects\n - D'Hoffryn\n\n",
"It didn't have to be this way. But you made your choice. I know you had a tough life. I know that some people think you had a lot of bad breaks. Well, boo-hoo!\n - Willow\n\n",
"It hurts sometimes more than we can bear. If we can live without passion, maybe we'd know some kind of peace. But we would be hollow. Empty rooms, shuttered and dank. Without passion, we'd be truly dead.\n - Angel\n\n",
"It is kinda strange, how you keep saving the world, and there's not any proof.\n - Xander\n\n",
"It is my great pleasure and privilege to announce the official opening, on the very ground that it first stood upon, of the brand-new, state-of-the-art, Sunnydale High!\n - Principal Wood\n\n",
"It must be a drag to be stuck here in Sweatydale, but I'm thinking of you.\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"It seems like we're always dealing with creatures from outer space. Except that we don't ever do that.\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"It was a nightmare, a total nightmare. I mean, they promised me they'd take me to St. Croix, and then they just decide to go to Tuscany. Art and buildings? I was totally beachless for a month and a half. No one has suffered like I have suffered. Of course, I think that that kind of adversity builds character. Well, then I thought, 'I already have a lot of character.' Is it possible to have too much character?\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"It was exactly you, Will, every detail. Except for your not being a dominatrix. As far as we know.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"It was terrible. I moped over you for months, sitting in my room, listening to that Divinyls song 'I Touch Myself'...of course, I had no idea what it was about.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"It's a little binding. I guess vampires really don't have to breathe. Gosh, look at those\n - Willow\n\n",
"It's all Faith's fault. She's like poison. No, worse, she's like acid that eats through everything. Maybe she's a bomb\n - Buffy\n\n",
"It's bad bowling. It's a double date, with all of us, and they're gonna know! It's a very intimate situation. It's all sexy with the smoke and the sweating and the shoe rental...\n - Willow\n\n",
"It's complicated... because of Tara\n - Willow\n\n",
"It's definitely the crypt, right? I'm not keen on tunneling into someone's septic tank.\n - Spike\n\n",
"It's good to have the taste of a Slayer back in my mouth. It's like cigarettes, you know? Just when I thought I'd quit\n - Angel\n\n",
"It's horrible. That's me as a vampire? I'm so evil, and skanky. And I think I'm kind of gay\n - Willow\n\n",
"It's incredible. I mean, I am so juiced Giles, it's like no mortal person has ever had this much power. Ever. It's like I'm connected to everything.\n - Willow\n\n",
"It's just you belong at a good old-fashioned college, with keg parties, and boys, not here with Hellmouths and vampires.\n - Joyce\n\n",
"It's like all of a sudden I'm not cool enough for you because I can't kill things with my bare hands\n - Willow\n\n",
"It's my fault the ritual didn't work. I screwed up. I'm little. I don't have as much blood as other people. And I probably should have told someone I'm anemic\n - Jonathan\n\n",
"It's my first day! I was afraid that I was gonna be behind in all my classes, that I wouldn't make any friends, that I would have last month's hair. I didn't think there'd be vampires on campus\n - Buffy\n\n",
"It's not like I'm snooping around for proof that you're some sort of whacked-out serial killer. I don't know why I said that. Forget I said that. It's craziness talking, it's just nerves. Nerves. Nerves and horniness. Oh, just shut up, William, and take me. Take me now\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"It's not the demon in me that needs killing, Buffy. It's the man.\n - Angel\n\n",
"It's officially nippy. So say my nips\n - Xander\n\n",
"It's okay, I'm-I'm sorry I almost ate you\n - Oz\n\n",
"It's very powerful, and probably very dangerous. It has a purifying power, a cleansing power... possibly scrubbing bubbles\n - Angel\n\n",
"It's what? Bells ringing, fireworks, the dulcet choir of pretty little birdies? Come on, Buffy! It's not like I've never been there before.\n - Angel\n\n",
"It's worth nothing, Harris. Whatever comes out of your mouth is a meaningless waste of breath, an airborne toxic event.\n - Principal Snyder\n\n",
"I’m the thing that monsters have nightmares about. And right now, you and me are gonna show ‘em why.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Japanese commercials are weird\n - Tara\n\n",
"Judgemental? If I was any more open-minded about the choices you two make, my whole brain would fall out\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Just because you're better than us doesn't mean you can be all superior\n - Xander\n\n",
"Just hit him, Buffy\n - Kendra\n\n",
"Just look at you, Faith. Less than 24 hours ago you killed a man. And now it's all zip-a-dee-doo-dah?\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Just meet me at Willow's house in half an hour and wear something trashy...er\n - Xander\n\n",
"Just relax... and take off your pants\n - Faith\n\n",
"Just sitting here, watching our barren lives pass us by. Oh, look, a cockroach.\n - Willow\n\n",
"Just sort of hoping you'd think I have an honest face\n - Riley\n\n",
"Just the beginning, love. A warm-up act. The real headliner's coming, and when that band hits the stage, all of this.. all this... will come tumbling in death and screaming, horror and bloodshed. From beneath you, it devours\n - Spike\n\n",
"Killing things with wood? Ooh, scary vampires--they die from a splinter\n - Dawn\n\n",
"Let me answer that question with a head-butt\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Let me get this straight: you think I'm evil if I take a group of teenage girls on a camping trip and I DON'T touch them?\n - Giles\n\n",
"Let me guess: leather pants, nice right cross, doe eyes, holier-than-thou glower... you must be Faith\n - Spike\n\n",
"Let's begin with the knee caps. No fun dancing without them!\n - Darla\n\n",
"Let's find the evil, and fight it together\n - Giles\n\n",
"Let's get this straight. I don't understand it. I don't wanna' understand it. You have gross emotional problems. And things are not okay between us.\n - Willow\n\n",
"Let's see how popular you are without a face\n - Warren\n\n",
"Like you could drive me at a gallop till my knees buckled. Squeeze me till I popped like warm champagne. That's not the kind of thing a man forgets\n - Spike\n\n",
"Listen to me, you stupid bint. This gem is everything. I came back to Sunnydale for it, a place which has witnessed some truly spectacular kickings of my ass\n - Spike\n\n",
"Look I know you find me attractive. I've seen you looking at my breasts\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"Look around. We're in my daddy's car. It's just the two of us. There is a beautiful, big, full moon outside tonight. It doesn't get more romantic than this. So shut up!\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Look at him. Have you ever seen anything so masculine?\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"Look at you. All afraid I'm hot for your honey\n - Spike\n\n",
"Look, Buffy, you may be hot stuff when it comes to demonology or whatever, but when it comes to dating, I'm the Slayer\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Looks like I get to kill two birds with one stone...and teacher makes three\n - Angel\n\n",
"Looks like the Hellmouth is officially closed for business\n - Faith\n\n",
"Loose cannon. Rock the boat. Is that a mixed metaphor? Boats did have cannons. And a loose one would cause it to rock.\n - Mayor Wilkins\n\n",
"Maggie tried to kill me\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Man can't turn his back on what he came from. Besides, black is slimming\n - Caleb\n\n",
"Man, Buffy! My whole life just flashed before my eyes. I gotta' get me a life!\n - Xander\n\n",
"Master, I deliver the Slayer. She who you most desire. Sorry -- 'whom\n - Xander\n\n",
"Maybe it's the syphilis talking, but some of that made sense\n - Xander\n\n",
"Men are evil. Will you go with me?\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"Mist... cemetery... Halloween. Should end well.\n - Giles\n\n",
"Mom started borrowing my clothes. There should be an age limit on Lycra pants. Dad, he just locked himself in the bathroom with old copies of Esquire\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Mom, I'm a Vampire Slayer.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Most beauteous and supremely magnificent one, this dark spell I hold in my worthless and scabby hand is our gift to you, most tingly and wonderful Glorificus\n - Glory's Minions\n\n",
"Most people don't use their tongues to say hello. Or I guess they do, but\n - Spike\n\n",
"Mother wrote things down. Hard data, but also her feelings. That's how I learned that I have a job here, and that she loved me\n - Adam\n\n",
"Murderous little fiend. Did you see what she did to my Faith?\n - Mayor Wilkins\n\n",
"My Dorothy Hamill phase. My room in LA was pretty much a shrine. Dorothy dolls, Dorothy posters. I even got the Dorothy haircut, thereby securing a place for myself in the Geek Hall of Fame.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"My God, you people are all...well, I'm upset and I can't think of a mean word right now, but that's what you are and we're going to the factory!\n - Willow\n\n",
"My diary? You read my diary? That is not okay! A diary is like a person's most private place! You don't even know what I was writing about!'Hunk'can mean a lot of things, bad things. And, and when it says that your eyes are'penetrating', I meant to write'bulging'. And'A'doesn't even stand for'Angel'for that matter, it stands for...'Achmed', a charming foreign exchange student, so that whole fantasy part has nothing to even do with you at all...\n - Buffy\n\n",
"My friends, we're about to make history...end.\n - Angel\n\n",
"My god, what a feeling. The power of these creatures. It suffuses my being. I can feel the changes begin. My organs are shifting, merging, making ready for the Ascension. Plus these babies are high in fiber, and what's the fun of becoming an immortal demon if you're not regular, am I right?\n - Mayor Wilkins\n\n",
"My point however, crazy or not, is pretty much the only plan. Besides, it's Buffy's, and she's slay gal. You know, little Miss Likes-to-fight\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"My predecessor, Mr. Flutie, may have gone in for that touchy- feely relating nonsense, but he was eaten. You're in my world now. And Sunnydale has touched and felt for the last time\n - Principal Snyder\n\n",
"My soul. It's really there. Kind of stings\n - Spike\n\n",
"My. She's... cheeky, isn't she?\n - Giles\n\n",
"No candles? Well, I brought one. It's extra flamey\n - Willow\n\n",
"No deaths, no eviscerations, you're not goading women into anything inventive, and you're no delivering when it is\n - Halfrek\n\n",
"No fair! Attacking... when I wasn't even looking. Oh, help. No. This is no good. I'm out of the moment. And you're not giving me anything I can use. (Glory beats Buffy up with little effort) Dreg, I'm not hearing chanting! Continue\n - Glorificus\n\n",
"No matter what she is, she still feels like my daughter. I have to know that you'll take care of her, that you'll keep her safe, that you'll love her like I love you\n - Joyce\n\n",
"No one has an older sister who's a Slayer. People wouldn't be so crazy about her if they had to live in the same house with her every single day. Everybody cares what she thinks, just 'cause she can do backflips and stuff. Like that's such a crucial job skill in the real world!\n - Dawn\n\n",
"No reason to get upset? Oh, right, sorry. I must just think there is because of my brain tumor!\n - Joyce\n\n",
"No snacking! I see blood on your lips and it's a visit to the wood shed for you boys\n - Mayor Wilkins\n\n",
"No vampires. Bunch of school kids in heavy mascara listening to extremely silly music.\n - Giles\n\n",
"No, Angel, it's not you. You're the one freaky thing in my freaky world that still makes sense to me.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"No, I don't want to kill you, Spike. I want to kill the monster who took my mother away from me\n - Principal Wood\n\n",
"No, no! Feels great. Strong, like I'm connected to a powerful, all-consuming evil that's going to suck the world into a fiery oblivion. How about you?\n - Holden Webster\n\n",
"No, no. No, your terrifically smooth one, it is the epitome of ankles. To touch such an ankle would be-- but I'm not touching, I'm backing away\n - Glory's Minions\n\n",
"No, she was never gone. She was with me. We should have been forever, and I – I let her be dead. She’s really dead. And I killed her.\n - Willow\n\n",
"No, this is different. Our love was eternal. Literally. You got any of those little marshmallows?\n - Spike\n\n",
"No, we're not going to leave you. And where'd you get that accent, Sesame Street? Von, two, three... three victims. Mwah, hahahhaha!\n - Xander\n\n",
"No, you'd be wonderful in the Army. Do you think the umbilical cord between you and Anya will stretch that far?\n - Willow\n\n",
"No. I'm a rebel. You're an idiot.\n - Spike\n\n",
"No. I'm powerful, and I'm beautiful, and I don't need you to complete me. And you're mean!\n - Harmony\n\n",
"No. See, you're not getting it, Mr. Bits. You're gonna be interestingly dead. Little Miss Tiny's got the habit of bollixing up the plans of every would-be unstoppable bad-ass who sets foot in this town. Just want you to know, when the big ugly goes down, Slayer's going to be right in the thick of it. You ready for that?\n - Spike\n\n",
"No. The fact that you're fat makes you look fat. That sweater just makes you look... purple\n - Sunday\n\n",
"Nobody harms my Master\n - Xander\n\n",
"Nooo... I think you're up in the clocktower with a high-powered rifle because you wanna blend in.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Not all that tension was about you. Giles was part of a plan to kill me... for Buffy's own good\n - Spike\n\n",
"Now it's a simple story -- stop me if you've heard it. I have found and truly believe that there's nothing so bad it cannot be made better with a story. And this one's got a happy ending. There once was a woman, and she was foul, like all women. For Adam's rib was dirty, just like Adam himself, for what was he but human? But this woman, she was filled... with darkness, despair, and why? Because she did not know. She could not see. She didn't know the good news, the glory that was coming. That'd be you. For the kingdom, the power and the glory are yours. Now and forever. You show up, they'll get in line. Because they followed her, now all they have to do is take one more step, and I'll kill them all. See? I told you it had a happy ending\n - Caleb\n\n",
"Now, Faith, I don't find that sort of thing amusing. I'm a family man. Now, let's kill your little friend. Don't worry, I wouldn't ask you to do it. Not this early in the relationship. Besides, I think a vampire attack would look less suspicious, anyway. In the meantime, let's look at the rest of the apartment, huh? If I'm not mistaken, some lucky girl has herself a PlayStation\n - Mayor Wilkins\n\n",
"Now, I know you haven't been in the game for a while, mate, but we still do kill people. Sort of our raison d'etre, you know.\n - Spike\n\n",
"Now, hold on! I'll do your spell for you, and, and, I'll get you Drusilla back, but there will be no bottle in face, and there will be no 'having' of any kind with me. All right?\n - Willow\n\n",
"Now, now. None of that. Or I won't help you get Red's mongrel back\n - Spike\n\n",
"Occasionally, I'm callous and strange\n - Willow\n\n",
"Of course I am. No Slayer of mine is gonna live in a fleabag hotel. That place has a very unsavory reputation. There are immoral liaisons going on there\n - Mayor Wilkins\n\n",
"Of course it did. It always does. Seen a thousand relationships. First there's the love and sex, then there's nothing left but the vengeance. That's how it works\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"Of course! That's why I'm on the lam. Didn't you hear? I'm totally her arch-nemesis\n - Harmony\n\n",
"Oh come on! Stake through the heart. A little sunlight. It's like falling off a log\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Oh god, please don't tell me I was fighting a vampire slayer! How unbelievably common. If I had friends and they heard about this...\n - Glorificus\n\n",
"Oh my god, he's looking at her! He's got his filthy, adult, Pierce-Brosny eyes all over my Cordy\n - Xander\n\n",
"Oh my god. I'm the pushy queen of slut-town!\n - Dawn\n\n",
"Oh please. I don't mean to interrupt your downward mobility, but I just wanted to tell you that you won't be meeting Coach Foster, the woman with the chest hair, because gym was cancelled due to the extreme dead guy in the locker.\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Oh yeah. Having the inside scoop on the administration's own Bay of Mutated Pigs is definitely an advantage\n - Riley\n\n",
"Oh yes! Like how the cow and the chicken come together even though they've never met. It's like Sleepless in Seattle if, if Meg and Tom were, like, minced.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Oh! That's my skirt! You're never gonna fit in it with those hips. We have to kill them\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Oh, Buffy. Don't cry. I'm sorry. I was too hard on you. Sometimes I unleash. I don't know my own strength. It's bad. I'm bad. I'm a bad, bad, bad person\n - Willow\n\n",
"Oh, God. Is the world ending? I have to research a paper on Bosnia for tomorrow, but if the world's ending, I'm not gonna bother\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Oh, I don't know. Looking in the mirror every day and seeing nothing there...it's an overrated pleasure\n - Angel\n\n",
"Oh, I see you. A man surrounded by fools who cannot see his strength, his vision, his glory. That, and burning baby fish swimming all around your head\n - Drusilla\n\n",
"Oh, I would kill to live in L.A. That close to that many shoes?\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Oh, I'd forgotten how much swords through the chest hurt\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"Oh, I'm Sunday. I'll be killing you here in a minute or so\n - Sunday\n\n",
"Oh, I'm up. I'm suddenly very up. It's just, um, I've never been up with people before\n - Xander\n\n",
"Oh, Spike! Of course it's yes! Giles! You'll never believe what's happened!\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Oh, but you can. You know I'd drain you drier than the Sahara if I had half a chance. And besides, I'm beyond pathetic\n - Spike\n\n",
"Oh, by the way, I like your dress.\n - The Master\n\n",
"Oh, god. I'm terrified. I didn't think. I mean... I just figured you'd be terrified and I would be sarcastic about it\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"Oh, good. The feeble banter portion of the fight\n - The Master\n\n",
"Oh, he's a vampire. Of course! But the cuddly kind, like a Care Bear with fangs?\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Oh, it has its moments. Paul has some good stuff, for instance. But overall, I find it a tad complicated. I like to keep things simple. Good folk, bad folk, clean folk, dirty folk\n - Caleb\n\n",
"Oh, it must be that whole 'Angel killed his girlfriend and tortured him' thing, and Giles is petty when it comes to stuff like that.\n - Xander\n\n",
"Oh, it's not really the kind of message you tell. It sort of involves finding the bodies of all your friends.\n - Angel\n\n",
"Oh, listen to Mary Poppins. He's got his crust all stiff and upper with that nancy-boy accent. [Everyone looking at him.] You Englishmen are always so... [pauses] Bloody hell! [Ticks off on his fingers] Sodding, blimey, shagging, knickers, bollocks, oh God! I'm English!\n - Spike\n\n",
"Oh, look at my poor neck... all bare and tender and exposed. All that blood, just pumping away\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Oh, no - oh, no! Spontaneous poetic exclamations. Lord, spare me college boys in love\n - Professor Walsh\n\n",
"Oh, no. No, this is no good at all\n - Mr. Trick\n\n",
"Oh, now look -- things don't go exactly your way, so here come the waterworks. Ain't that just like a woman\n - Caleb\n\n",
"Oh, pouty. Look at that lip. Gonna get it. Gonna... get it\n - Spike\n\n",
"Oh, right, me and Oz play Mistress of Pain every night\n - Willow\n\n",
"Oh, right. 'Cause the burden of being beautiful and athletic, that's a crippler\n - Jonathan\n\n",
"Oh, she just said you look even cuter when you're all weak and kitten-y, and she'd better go solo, or you'd get hurt\n - Dawn\n\n",
"Oh, sod the spell. Your friends are at the factory. I'm really glad I came here, you know? I've been all wrongheaded about this - weeping, crawling, blaming everybody else. I want Dru back, I've just got to be the man I was. The man she loved. I'm going to do what I should have done in the first place. I'll find her, wherever she is, tie her up, torture her until she likes me again. Love's a funny thing.\n - Spike\n\n",
"Oh, someone put a stake in me\n - Spike\n\n",
"Oh, that's very humorous. Make fun of the ex-demon. I can just hear you in private: 'I dislike that Anya. She's newly human and strangely literal\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"Oh, well. Here is my talisman. You change your mind, give us a chant\n - D'Hoffryn\n\n",
"Oh, yeah. It has a little wheel with a plastic ball and a cute little bell in it. God! Somebody's domesticated the hell out of you\n - Veruca\n\n",
"Oh, you mean an orgasm friend?\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"Oh, you're a piece of work. I like you\n - Spike\n\n",
"Oh. Yes, I am a lesbian\n - Riley\n\n",
"Okay, I'm cookie dough. I'm not done baking. I'm not finished becoming whatever the hell it is I'm gonna turn out to be. I make it through this, and the next thing, and the next thing, and... maybe one day I turn around and realize I'm ready. I'm cookies. And then, you know, if I want someone to eat--- or enjoy warm, delicious cookie me, then, that's fine. That'll be then. When I'm done.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Okay, I'm trying to be supportive here, so don't drive a stake through my heart like last time. But you can't kill Buffy. She's the Slayer. She is so gonna kick your ass\n - Harmony\n\n",
"Okay, a scenario: you back off, I'll back off, but you promise not to go all wiggy until we can go to my Watcher and figure this out.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Okay, fine. Hide behind your boyfriend. But guess what? I have a boyfriend, too, and he's gonna be mad that you were mean to me\n - Harmony\n\n",
"Okay, okay, it was my first kiss. (upset) I know, I know, I suck, my lips are dry and my tongue's all horrible and sticky and I'm pretty sure I drooled on you... so just please tell me how awful it was\n - Dawn\n\n",
"Okay, remember before you became Hugh Hefner, when you used to be a Watcher?\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Okay, say that I help. And you start a conversation. It goes great. You like Buffy, she likes you. You spend time together, feelings grow deeper, and one day, without even realizing it, you find you're in love. Time stops, and it feels like the whole world is made for you two, and you two alone. Until the day one of you leaves, and rips the still-beating heart from the other, who's now a broken, hollow, mockery of the human condition\n - Willow\n\n",
"Okay, so one vote from the Old Guy for a Smelly Cheese Night, and how many votes for actual fun, huh?\n - Xander\n\n",
"Okay, somebody explain the whole 'He will suck the whole world into Hell' thing 'cause that's the part I'm not loving.\n - Willow\n\n",
"Okay, then. Just another little piece of the Buffy puzzle\n - Riley\n\n",
"Okay. I'm not panicking. I'm not. I'm not. Stop looking at me like I'm panicking\n - Xander\n\n",
"Okay. No biting, though\n - Willow\n\n",
"Once again, the Hellmouth puts the special in special occasion.\n - Oz\n\n",
"One day, the campus is completely bare, empty. The next, there are children everywhere...like locusts. Crawling around, mindlessly bent on feeding and mating. Destroying everything in sight in their relentless, pointless desire to exist\n - Principal Snyder\n\n",
"Ooo! Hello, salty goodness! Pick up the phone, call 911. That boy is gonna need some serious oxygen after I'm through with him..\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Ooo, again, I strike the nerve. I am the surgeon of mean.\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Ooo, is some evil going on?\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Ooo, look, it's Mr. Excitement. On another life-or-death doughnut mission, or are we just cruising for bimbos again, giving them lessons in lack of cool?\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Or you're the wolf all the time. And this human face is just your disguise\n - Veruca\n\n",
"Ouch!!! Please get your extreme oafishness off my two hundred dollar shoes\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Out! I mean it. I've been doing a lot of reading, and I'm in control of my own power now, so we're through\n - Harmony\n\n",
"Out. For. A. Walk... Bitch.\n - Spike\n\n",
"Outside of drugs and violence and unwanted pregnancy, and unleashing of hordes of Armageddon that comes pouring out of the school's foundation every now and then, what troubles could these kids have?\n - Xander\n\n",
"Ow! You sissy kicker!\n - Harmony\n\n",
"Oz ate someone last night\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Oz does not eat people. It's more werewolf play. You know, I bat you around a little bit, like a cat toy. I have harmless wolf fun. Is it Oz's fault that, you know, side effect, people get cut to ribbons, and maybe then he'll take a little nibble and... I'm not helping, am I?\n - Willow\n\n",
"Oz is not dangerous. Something happened to him that wasn't his fault. God, I never knew you were such a bigot\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Oz, don't you love me?\n - Willow\n\n",
"Oz, now might be a good time for your trademark stoicism\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Oz, you okay? If it's possible, you seem more monosyllabic than usual\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Passion is the source of our finest moments. The joy of love, the clarity of hatred, and the ecstasy of grief\n - Angel\n\n",
"Passion. It lies in all of us. Sleeping, waiting, and though unwanted, unbidden, it will stir. Open it's jaws, and howl. It speaks to us, guides us. Passion rules us all, and we obey. What other choice do we have?\n - Angel\n\n",
"Passion…it lies in all of us. Sleeping, waiting, and though unwanted, unbidden, it will stir, open its jaws, and howl. It speaks to us, guides us… passion rules us all. And we obey. What other choice do we have? Passion is the source of our finest moments; the joy of love, the clarity of hatred, and the ecstasy of grief. It hurts sometimes more than we can bear. If we could live without passion, maybe we’d truly know some kind of peace. But we would be hollow. Empty rooms, shuttered and dank… without passion, we’d truly be dead.\n - Angelus\n\n",
"Payback's a bitch\n - Faith\n\n",
"People who think their problems are so huge craze me, like this time I sort of ran over this girl on her bike. It was the most traumatizing event of my life, and she's trying to make it about her leg. Like my pain meant nothing\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Planning life as a loser? Most people just turn out that way, but you're really taking charge.\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Please, how many times have I heard that line in my demon days. 'I'm so rotten they don't even have a name for it. I'm bad. Baddy, bad, bad, bad. Does it make you horny?' Or terrified. Whatever\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"Potential slayers can function without sleep. Me, I'm no good without my usual 90 minutes\n - Xander\n\n",
"Power to the people? You sound like a child of the seventies\n - Giles\n\n",
"Pretty bitchin', right? I'm like Obi Wan\n - Warren\n\n",
"Prince of Night, I summon you. Come fill me with your black, naughty evil.\n - Willow\n\n",
"Put the stake down\n - Dracula\n\n",
"Quiet! You'll miss the humourous conclusion\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"Recording bat sonar is something soothingly akin to having one's teeth drilled.\n - Giles\n\n",
"Remember the three key words for any Slayer: Preparation... preparation... preparation\n - Giles\n\n",
"Remember, fast and brutal. It's gonna be a whole new world come nightfall, don't want to weaken now. And boys? Let's watch the swearing\n - Mayor Wilkins\n\n",
"Right now you're asking yourself, 'What makes this different? What makes us anything more than a bunch of girls being picked off one by one?'\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Right. I count four limbs, a head, no visible scarring, so I assume your personal issue wasn't a life-threatening accident of any kind, and I'm therefore uninterested\n - Professor Walsh\n\n",
"Riley's a doof. He's not teutonic\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Sarcasm accomplishes nothing, Giles\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Saw a man about a girl. I went to seek a legend out. Traveled to the other side of the world, made a deal with a demon\n - Spike\n\n",
"Say it's true. Say I do want to... it wouldn't be you, Spike. It would never be you. You're beneath me\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Scout's honour\n - Adam\n\n",
"See, I didn't think this was a popularity contest. I should have equal time to bake them cookies, braid their hair...\n - Buffy\n\n",
"See, I don't get that. All this 'leaving for her own good' garbage. Because that's what it is! You can't just give up because there's obstacles. You know, what kind of--\n - Willow\n\n",
"See, this is what I hate about you vampires. Sex and death and love and pain -- it's all the same damn thing to you\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Seize the moment, ‘cause tomorrow you might be dead.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Seven years, Dawn. Working with the Slayer. Seeing my friends get more and more powerful... a witch. A demon. Hell, I could fit Oz in my shaving kit, but come a full moon, he had a wolfy mojo not to be messed with. Powerful, all of them. And I'm the guy who fixes the windows\n - Xander\n\n",
"Sexual intercourse. I've said it, like, a dozen times\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"She gets to fondle the money?\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"She lives very much in the now, and well, history is very much about the then\n - Giles\n\n",
"She made me feel like a human being. That's not the kind of thing you just forgive\n - Angel\n\n",
"She still thinks I'm little Miss Nobody. Just her dumb little sister. Boy, is she in for a surprise\n - Dawn\n\n",
"She wished her husband's head would explode, which was great, except we were standing three feet from him at the time. What a mess. Of course, you know, during the plague, it was always parts falling off, but... that got pretty old since really they pretty much were anyway...\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"She won't give up until she's killed me to death\n - Harmony\n\n",
"She wouldn't even kill me. She just left. She didn't even care enough to cut off my head, or set me on fire. I mean, is that too much to ask? You know? Some little sign that she cared? It was the truce with Buffy that did it. Dru said I'd gone soft - wasn't demon enough for the likes of her\n - Spike\n\n",
"She's cute. Not too bright, though. Gave the puppy dog'I'm all tortured'act. Keeps her off my back when I feed!\n - Angel\n\n",
"She's like this cleavagey slutbomb walking around going, 'Ooh, check me out. I'm wicked cool. I'm five-by-five\n - Willow\n\n",
"She's pretty, Angel. A little skinny. Still don't understand why it couldn't work out with you and my Faith. I guess you kinda just have strange tastes in women\n - Mayor Wilkins\n\n",
"Shh, here comes my favorite part. Where the Slayers see us in the hall together, thick as thieves. Oh, wait, we are thieves. And worse\n - Mayor Wilkins\n\n",
"Shh. Rrruff. Bad dog\n - Drusilla\n\n",
"Since the picture you just painted means that I will never touch food of any kind again, you'll just have to pick it up yourself\n - Giles\n\n",
"Sissy\n - Spike\n\n",
"So Buffy took some time off right in the middle of the apocalypse and it was her decision?\n - Spike\n\n",
"So I told him that I loved him... and I kissed him... and I killed him\n - Buffy\n\n",
"So I'm a vampire. How weird is that?\n - Holden Webster\n\n",
"So I'm treated like the baddie, just because he has a sprained wrist and a bloody nose...and I don't have a scratch on me. Which, granted, hurts my case a little, on the surface.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"So can I go now? She doesn't need this many stakes. I mean, if this guy Spike is as mean as you all said, it should be over pretty quickly.\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"So dump him. But you can't have Xander\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"So he is a good vampire! I mean, on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being someone who's killing and maiming every night, and 1 being someone who's...not.\n - Willow\n\n",
"So let me get this straight. You're... Dracula, the guy, the Count\n - Buffy\n\n",
"So many body parts, so few bullets. Let's begin with the kneecaps. No fun dancing without them.\n - Darla\n\n",
"So tell me, why am I not popping your head like a zit right now?'\n - Glorificus\n\n",
"So the Mayor of Sunnydale is a Black Hat. That's a shocker, huh?\n - Faith\n\n",
"So there is something I can do? Besides . . . scream like a woman?\n - Giles\n\n",
"So this spell might restore Angel's humanity? Well, here's an interesting angle: who cares?\n - Xander\n\n",
"So you haven't murdered anybody lately? Let's be best pals!\n - Buffy\n\n",
"So you're saying I should spend the whole night with you... alone. Locked in a cage\n - Veruca\n\n",
"So, I'm wondering, do the other cookie animals feel sorta ripped? Like, is the hippo going,'Hey, man, where are my pants? I have my hippo dignity!'And you know the monkey's just,'I mock you with my monkey pants!\n - Oz\n\n",
"So, either you hit her, or you did your wacky mime routine for her.\n - Oz\n\n",
"So, um, I was missing something this afternoon, wasn't I? I mean, breakups are tough, but when Oz walked in, it seemed like emotions were running extra high\n - Riley\n\n",
"So, we got to Brazil, and she was... she was just different. I gave her everything - beautiful jewels, beautiful dresses with beautiful girls in them, but nothing made her happy. And she would flirt! I caught her on a park bench, making out with a chaos demon! Have you ever seen a chaos demon? They're all slime and antlers. They're disgusting.\n - Spike\n\n",
"So, what I'm wondering is, does this always happen? Sleep with a guy and he goes all evil?\n - Buffy\n\n",
"So, you deliver these HST's to a bunch of lab-coats who perform experiments on them, which, among other things, turns some into harmless little bunnies. How am I doing so far?\n - Buffy\n\n",
"So? What are friends for? I mean, I'm sorry, it's just, all this sweating nightly, side-by-side action, and you never put in for a little after-hours (grunt)?\n - Faith\n\n",
"Something's killing girls all over the world trying to end the Slayer line. Thing like that, figure I might get a heads-up\n - Faith\n\n",
"Sometimes our missions end up with you trying to kill me. I'm not fond of those.\n - Spike\n\n",
"Sometimes that's how people relate. Being mean to each other. Even mortal enemies. Then with the... And that leads to no good, absolutely no good.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Sometimes when I'm sitting in class -- you know, I'm not thinking about class, 'cause that would never happen -- I think about kissing you, and it's like everything stops. It's like, it's like freeze frame. Willow kissage\n - Oz\n\n",
"Soon he'll be sweating. I'm imagining having sex with him again\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"Sooner or later... you're gonna want it. And the second--the second that happens, you know I'll be there. I'll slip in... have myself a real good day. Here endeth the lesson\n - Spike\n\n",
"Sorry about the chains. It's not that I don't trust you, it's... Actually, it is that I don't trust you\n - Angel\n\n",
"Sorry to barge in. I'm afraid we have a slight apocalypse\n - Giles\n\n",
"Sorry, Angel. Changed the locks\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Sorry, Jenny, this is where you get off\n - Angel\n\n",
"Sorry. I was in the moment\n - Drusilla\n\n",
"Spike and I are getting married!\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Spike's working for Adam?!? After all we've done-- Nah, I can't even act surprised\n - Xander\n\n",
"Spike, I just saw you taste your own nose blood. You know what? I'm too grossed out to hear anything you have to say!\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Spike, have you completely lost your mind?\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Spike, the only chance you had with me was when I was unconscious.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Spike, this basement is killing you. This is the Hellmouth. There is something bad down here. Possibly everything bad\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Spike, you're the worst type of scum. the second you're back to your old tricks, well... let's just say, before you even sniff out your first victim, you'll be pretty indistinguishable from - oh, what should we say? - instant soup mix\n - Jonathan\n\n",
"Spikey, let's leave the Slayer alone. You know she'll only slap you around, and I can do that\n - Harmony\n\n",
"Splendid. Well, it's ages since I've been to a gig. Well, don't look that way. I'm...I'm...I'm down with the new music. And I have the albums to prove it.\n - Giles\n\n",
"Squeak... squeak... squeak...\n - Amy\n\n",
"Stay in character, remember your lines, and energy, energy, energy, especially in the musical numbers!\n - Giles\n\n",
"Stop calling me that - I'm not your brother. You're a botched science experiment. I'm a human being, who's gonna do everything in his power to...\n - Riley\n\n",
"Strangely, I feel like staying at home... and doing my homework... and flossing... and dying a virgin\n - Willow\n\n",
"Strong is fighting. It’s hard and it’s painful and it’s every day. It’s what we have to do, and we can do it together, but if you’re too much of a coward for that, then burn.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Such a pretty house you have, sweet William. It smells of daffodils... and viscera\n - Drusilla\n\n",
"Sunnydale owes you a debt. It will be repaid. Yes, sir, we'll mark that invoice 'Paid in full\n - Mayor Wilkins\n\n",
"Sure, alternate realities. You could uh, could have like a world without shrimp. Or with, you know, nothing but shrimp. Just don't ask me to live there!\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"Sure. We can work out after school. You know, if you're not too busy having sex with my MOTHER\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Sure. We saved the world, I say we party. I mean, I got all pretty.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Tact is just not saying true stuff. I'll pass.\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Tara's your girlfriend?\n - Xander\n\n",
"Taste my blade, spawn of evil!\n - Dawn\n\n",
"Tell me that if you don't get in a good slaying, after a while, you just start itching for some vamp to show up so you can give him a good -- (grunt)\n - Faith\n\n",
"Tell me where the key is, or I'm going bowling\n - Glorificus\n\n",
"Tell you what I'll do, then. I'll head out, find this girl, tell her exactly where all of you are, and then watch... as she kills you. Can't any one of your damned little Scooby club at least try to remember that I hate you all?\n - Spike\n\n",
"Testosterone is a great equalizer. It turns all men into morons. He will, however, get over it.\n - Giles\n\n",
"Thanks for clearing that up, 'cause otherwise we might've thought you were up to no good here at the satanic manhole cover.\n - Xander\n\n",
"Thanks for coming with. Hunting for a psychopathic super-bitch is definitely in the above-and-beyond category\n - Willow\n\n",
"Thanksgiving isn't about the blending of two cultures. It's about one culture wiping out another. And then they make animated specials about the part where, with the maize and the big, big belt buckles. They don't show you the next scene, where all the bison die and Squanto takes a musket ball in the stomach.\n - Willow\n\n",
"That Summers girl--I smell trouble. I smell expulsion, and just the faintest aroma of jail.\n - Principal Snyder\n\n",
"That smell, your neck. I haven't had a woman in weeks\n - Spike\n\n",
"That tickles. Ooh, oh, uh... oh, dear god\n - Giles\n\n",
"That was bracing\n - Giles\n\n",
"That was kind of beautiful. You... you love humans\n - Andrew\n\n",
"That's boring. I just want to do the money parts.\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"That's disturbing. You're emotionally scarred and will end up badly.\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"That's good. You're hurting me. That's good too\n - Darla\n\n",
"That's great, Riley, and, you know, there's no polite way to ask you this, but, uh... did they put a chip in your brain?\n - Xander\n\n",
"That's not your world. You belong in the shadows... with me.\n - Spike\n\n",
"That's one spunky little girl you've raised. I'm gonna eat her\n - Mayor Wilkins\n\n",
"That's right! Big bad's back, and lookin' for a little death\n - Spike\n\n",
"That's right! I'm back, and I'm a bloody animal! Yeah!\n - Spike\n\n",
"That's right, big boy. Come and get it.\n - Willow\n\n",
"That's so cute. Planning life as a loser? Most people just turn out that way, but you're really taking charge\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"That's the kind of wooly: headed liberal thinking that leads to being eaten\n - Principal Snyder\n\n",
"That's the reason I love this country. You make a good product, and the people will come to you. Of course, a lot of them are going to die, but that's the other reason I love this country.\n - Mr. Trick\n\n",
"That's the thing about a coma. You wake up all rested and rejuvenated, and ready for payback\n - Faith\n\n",
"That's the worst attempted pig slaughtering I've ever seen\n - Warren\n\n",
"The Council is not welcome here. I have no time for orders. If I need someone to scream like a woman I'll give you a call\n - Buffy\n\n",
"The Earth is doomed.\n - Giles\n\n",
"The Force can sometimes have great power on the weak-minded.\n - Warren\n\n",
"The Slayer. It's time,Angel. She's ready for you now. She's dancing. Dancing with death\n - Drusilla\n\n",
"The comedy stylings of Miss Cordelia Chase, everyone. Who, incidentally, won't be needing a higher education when she markets her own very successful line of hooker wear\n - Xander\n\n",
"The coven is-- They're the most amazing women I've ever met. But there's this... this look that they get. Like I'm gonna turn them all into bangers and mash, or something. Which I'm not even really sure what that is\n - Willow\n\n",
"The elders conjured up the perfect punishment for me: they restored my soul.\n - Angel\n\n",
"The fast-growing field of personal grooming has come a long way since you became a vampire.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"The gem of Amarra. Official sponsor of my killing you\n - Spike\n\n",
"The girl need some monster in her man. And that's not in your nature. No matter how low you try to go\n - Spike\n\n",
"The hardest thing in this world is to live in it. Be brave. Live.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"The important thing is, you made me the man I am today.\n - Angel\n\n",
"The joint changes you. I hear they like the small ones, with little hands like their girlfriends\n - Jonathan\n\n",
"The last time I looked in on you two, you were fighting to the death. Now you're back making googly-eyes at each other again like nothing happened. Makes me want to heave\n - Spike\n\n",
"The magic wasn't all great. I won't miss the nosebleeds and the headaches and stuff... or keeping stinky yak cheese in my bra.\n - Willow\n\n",
"The one and only, the original, accept-no-substitute Slayer\n - Caleb\n\n",
"The other part that totally weirded me out, that thing had good taste. He chucked Xander and went right for the formalwear\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"The part that gets me, though, is where Buffy is the Vampire Slayer. She's so little.\n - Miss Calendar\n\n",
"The problem is, what kind of girl is gonna go out with a guy who's acting all joe regular by day and then turns all demon-hunter by night?\n - Riley\n\n",
"The show's not over, but there will be a short intermission. Don't want to miss the 2nd act. All kinds of excitement\n - Mayor Wilkins\n\n",
"The thing about the Slayer is, she is a whiney little thing, but when it comes to the fighting, she does have a slight tendency to win\n - Spike\n\n",
"The thing is, I think Riley's okay in an oafish kind of way, but am I the only one with a big, floating question-mark over his head about this Initiative thing?\n - Xander\n\n",
"The whole earth may be sucked into hell, and you want my help 'cause your girlfriend's a big 'ho? Well, let me take this opportunity to not care.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Then, talk. Keep eye contact. Funny is good, but don't be glib. And remember, if you hurt her, I will beat you to death with a shovel. A vague disclaimer is nobody's friend. Have fun!\n - Willow\n\n",
"There's a certain dramatic irony attached to all this. A synchronicity that borders on predestination, one might say\n - Giles\n\n",
"There's evil. Down here. Right here. I'm a bad man. William is a bad man. I hurt the girl\n - Spike\n\n",
"There's nothing uncool about healthy teeth and bones\n - Mayor Wilkins\n\n",
"These are moments you want to savor. You wish time would stop so that you could live them over and over again. You're expelled\n - Principal Snyder\n\n",
"They can be such a...oh, I-I don't wanna' say 'burden', but uh...uh, actually I kind of do want to say 'burden\n - Joyce\n\n",
"They do spells and stuff, which is so much cooler than Slaying. I told Mom one time I wished they'd teach me some of the things they do together. And then she got really quiet and made me go upstairs\n - Dawn\n\n",
"They never just leave. Always gotta say something.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"They were supposed to be my light at the end of the tunnel. I guess they were a train.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"They'll never know how tough it is, Dawnie, to be the one who isn't Chosen, to live so near the spotlight and never step in it. But I know. I see more than anybody realizes because nobody's watching me. I saw you last night. I see you working here today. You're not special. You're extraordinary.\n - Xander\n\n",
"Things used to be pretty simple. Hundred years, just hanging out, feeling guilty, really honed my brooding skills. Then she comes along. Yeah, I get jealous.\n - Angel\n\n",
"Think I still dream of a crypt for two with a white picket fence? My eyes are clear.\n - Spike\n\n",
"This big evil that's been promising to devour us? Well, I think it's started chomping\n - Willow\n\n",
"This cheerleading trophy. It's like its eyes follow you wherever you go. I like it.\n - Oz\n\n",
"This is Spike. He's um.. It's a really long story b-but he's not bad anymore\n - Buffy\n\n",
"This is a time of celebration. So sit still and be quiet. Spit out that gum\n - Principal Snyder\n\n",
"This is all about me! Me, me, me!\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"This is getting to be a pattern with you, Buffy. Are there any friends of yours left you haven't tried to kill?\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"This is great. There's an unkillable demon in town, Angel's joined his side, the Slayer's a basket case, I'd say we've hit bottom\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"This is not gonna' be pretty. We're talkin' violence, strong language, adult content.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"This isn't a relationship. You don't need me. All you care about is lots of orgasms\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"This isn't an orgy, people. It's a classroom\n - Principal Snyder\n\n",
"This isn't going to get all sexy, is it?\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"This isn't some fairy tale. When I kiss you...you don't wake up from a deep sleep and live happily ever after\n - Angel\n\n",
"This one tastes funny. Take me out to eat\n - Harmony\n\n",
"This warlock in Romania sent me to the monks there to learn some meditation techniques. Very intense. All about keeping your inner cool\n - Oz\n\n",
"Those of you who fall into my good graces will come to know me as Maggie. Those of you who don't, will come to know me by the name my TA's use and think I don't know about, 'The Evil bitch-monster of death\n - Professor Walsh\n\n",
"Time was you would've taken her out in a heartbeat. Now look at you. I bet this, uh, tortured thing is an act, right? You're not... housebroken?\n - Spike\n\n",
"To kill this girl, you have to love her.\n - Angel\n\n",
"Tonight, I shall walk the Earth, and the stars themselves will hide!\n - The Master\n\n",
"Touch me and my sister's gonna kill you\n - Dawn\n\n",
"Trouble? She's the gnat in my ear. The gristle in my teeth. She's the bloody thorn in my bloody side!\n - Spike\n\n",
"Unfortunately, that's all I could get out of my informant before his aggressive tendencies forced me to introduce him to Mr. Pointy\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Using the shredder gives me a lift. It's fun\n - Mayor Wilkins\n\n",
"Veruca was right about something. The wolf is inside me all the time, and I don't know where that line is anymore between me and it. And until I figure out what that means, I shouldn't be around you... or anybody\n - Oz\n\n",
"Waitress downtown wished her husband was a frog... you made him French!\n - Halfrek\n\n",
"Warren's the boss. He's Picard, you're Deanna Troi. Get used to the feeling, Betazoid\n - Andrew\n\n",
"Wasn't Jonathan just the cutest thing?\n - Andrew\n\n",
"We attack the Mayor with hummus\n - Oz\n\n",
"We can't actually do any of those things. You'd lose your soul, and besides, I don't even own a kimono\n - Buffy\n\n",
"We didn't come here to talk about Willow. We came here to do things... I can never tell my father about because he still thinks I'm a...good girl\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"We don't know much about them except for they're very ugly, and they're very mobile for blind people\n - Andrew\n\n",
"We have some very amusing chicken feet you can play with\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"We killed a homeless man on this bench. Me and Dru. Those were good times. You know, he begged for mercy, and that only made her bite harder\n - Spike\n\n",
"We like to talk big... vampires do. 'I'm going to destroy the world.' That's just tough-guy talk. Strutting around with your friends over a pint of blood. The truth is, I _like_ this world. You've got...dog racing, Manchester united. And you've got people. Billions of people walking around like Happy Meals with legs. It's all right here. But then someone comes along with a vision. With a real... passion for destruction. Angel could pull it off. Good-bye, Picadilly. Farewell, Leicester-bloody-Square.\n - Spike\n\n",
"We use the latest in scientific technology, and state-of-the-art weaponry, and you, if I understand correctly, poke them with a sharp stick\n - Professor Walsh\n\n",
"We were gonna light a bunch of candles and have sex near them.\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"We're Slayers, girlfriend. The Chosen two. Why should we let him take all the fun out of it?\n - Faith\n\n",
"We're going to destroy the world. Want to come?\n - Drusilla\n\n",
"We're like super villains\n - Jonathan\n\n",
"We're not friends. We never were. And I can fool Giles, and I can fool my friends, but I can't fool myself. Or Spike, for some reason. What I want from you I can never have\n - Buffy\n\n",
"We're not good friends. Most of us never found the time to get to know you. But that doesn't mean we haven't noticed you. We don't talk about it much, but it's no secret that Sunnydale High isn't really like other high schools. A lot of weird stuff happens here. But whenever there was a problem or something creepy happened, you seemed to show up and stop it. Most of the people here have been saved by you, or helped by you at one time or another. We're proud to say that the Class of '99 has the lowest mortality rate of any graduating class in Sunnydale history. And we know at least part of that is because of you. So the senior class offers its thanks, and gives you, uh, this. It's from all of us, and it has written here: Buffy Summers - Class Protector.\n - Jonathan\n\n",
"We're outlaws with hearts of gold\n - Andrew\n\n",
"We're still all rooting for you on Saturday. I'd be there for you myself if I didn't have a leg wax\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"We're your arch-nemesises... ses.\n - Warren\n\n",
"Weird'? It's against all laws of God and Man! It's...Cordelia, remember? Th-the We Hate Cordelia Club of which you are the Treasurer!\n - Willow\n\n",
"Well, I gotta have something. I still have Buffy taste in my mouth\n - Spike\n\n",
"Well, I guess it could be worse. I could have gangrene on my face.\n - Xander\n\n",
"Well, I guess that qualifies as 'happy to see me'\n - Angel\n\n",
"Well, I like you. You're nice, and you're funny, and you don't smoke. Yeah, okay, werewolf, but...that's not all the time. I mean, three days out of the month, I'm not much fun to be around either\n - Willow\n\n",
"Well, I think that's a shame. I love a ritual sacrifice\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"Well, I was using the phrase 'watch her back' as a euphemism for looking at her butt. You know, sort of a pun.\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Well, I'm a hair's breadth from investigating bunnies at the moment, so I'm open to anything\n - Giles\n\n",
"Well, I'm not saying it's the key to her heart, but Buffy, she likes cheese\n - Willow\n\n",
"Well, Spike... I'm here, obviously... for... um, sex\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"Well, a man that worships chaos and tries to kill you is a man you can trust\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Well, how about this? We whip out the ouija board, light a few candles, summon some ancient, unstoppable evil. Mayhem, mayhem, mayhem.\n - Xander\n\n",
"Well, if at first you don't succeed, I'll kill him\n - Spike\n\n",
"Well, if you can tell me... who's that guy?\n - Angel\n\n",
"Well, isn't this usually the part where you... kick me in the head and run out, virtue fluttering?\n - Spike\n\n",
"Well, it must be that whole Angel-killed-his-girlfriend-and-tortured-him thing. Hey, Giles is pretty petty when it comes to stuff like that.\n - Xander\n\n",
"Well, it went fine until Angel showed up and told Buffy's mom that he and Buffy had--well, you know, that...they had...you know...you do know, right?\n - Willow\n\n",
"Well, it's almost like this metaphor for womanhood, isn't it? This sort of flowering that happens when a girl realizes that she's part of a fertile heritage stretching back to Eve, and...\n - Andrew\n\n",
"Well, it's just good to know that when the chips are down and things look grim, you'll feed on the girl who loves you to save your own ass\n - Xander\n\n",
"Well, let's go save 'em, by gum\n - Spike\n\n",
"Well, let's see, um, six feet tall, claws, a big old snout in the middle of his face like a wolf. Um, yeah, I'm sticking with my first guess.\n - Xander\n\n",
"Well, no. I wasn't actually one of the original members of Pink Floyd, but... About the monster stuff, yes\n - Giles\n\n",
"Well, now what? We hold hands and chant Kumbaya or something?\n - Kennedy\n\n",
"Well, technically, Faith isn't a monster. And as far as fighting, I'd be lucky to bruise her fist with my face\n - Willow\n\n",
"Well, thank you for the generous life-saving. Now please go away\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"Well, that makes me feel better about me. Worse about Giles. Kind of shaky about you\n - Faith\n\n",
"Well, the Slayer always says a pun or a witty play on words, and I think it throws the vampires off and it makes 'em frightened because I'm wisecracking, okay, I didn't really have a chance to work on that one but you try it every time!\n - Willow\n\n",
"Well, then, let me. You're part of some military monster squad that captures demons, vampires - probably have some official sounding euphemisms for them, like... unfriendlies, or non-sapiens\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Well, this is exciting, isn't it? Clandestine meetings by dark of night, exchange of prisoners. I just, I... I feel like we should all be wearing trenchcoats\n - Mayor Wilkins\n\n",
"Well, this is exciting. A Slayer, up for murder one. That's sunshine and roses to me, it really is\n - Mayor Wilkins\n\n",
"Well, to the casual observer, it would appear that you're trying to make your friend Xander jealous, or even the score, or something. And...that's on the empty side. See, in my fantasy, when I'm kissing you, you're kissing me. It's okay, I can wait.\n - Oz\n\n",
"Well, when I'm with a boy I like, it's hard for me to say anything cool or witty or at all. I can usually make a few vowel sounds, and then I have to go away\n - Willow\n\n",
"Well, when you've been around since Columbus, you're bound to pile up a few ex's. You're older than him, right? Just between us girls, you are looking a little worn around the eyes\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Well, why can't you just masturbate like the rest of us?\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"Well, you and your great poof here want to tag along, that's fine\n - Spike\n\n",
"Well, you're not staying here. You can't buy me off with shiny beads and sweet-talk. You got Angel-breath. I'm not gonna let you just whack me back and forth like a rubber ball. I got my pride, you know\n - Spike\n\n",
"Were you planning to slit my throat any time soon?\n - Joyce\n\n",
"Were you... were you just smelling her sweater?\n - Riley\n\n",
"Werewolf groupie. Nobody else gets it done for me\n - Veruca\n\n",
"What I want is the Spike that's dangerous. The Spike that tried to kill me when we met\n - Buffy\n\n",
"What a total disaster. My first plan! I so wanted it to go well. Plus, I didn't even get to kill stupid Xander Harris! God, that was so embarrassing\n - Harmony\n\n",
"What about me? I love you so much. And I tried to make you go away. I killed you and it didn't help. And I hate it!\n - Buffy\n\n",
"What am I gonna do? I think about sex all the time. Sex. Help! 4 times 5 is 30. 5 times 6 is 32. Naked girls. Naked women. Naked Buffy. Oh, stop me!\n - Xander\n\n",
"What can I say? I work in mysterious ways. Also some fairly straightforward ones\n - Caleb\n\n",
"What do you think happened? Another demon woman was attracted to me. I'm going gay! I've decided I'm turning gay. Willow, gay me up. Come on, let's gay\n - Xander\n\n",
"What gives you the right to suck face with your demon lover again?\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"What is it with you and Slayers? Maybe I should dress up as one, and put a stake to your throat\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"What is your childhood trauma?!?!\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"What kind of girl travels with a mummified corpse? And doesn't even pack a lipstick?\n - Buffy\n\n",
"What relationship? I mean, what life could they possibly have together? We're talking obedience school, paper training. Oz is always in the back, burying their thangs, and that kind of breed can turn on its owner\n - Xander\n\n",
"What was he? A-a demon? A giant bug? Some kind of dark god with the secrets of nouvelle cuisine? I mean, we are talking creature- feature here, right?\n - Xander\n\n",
"What was the highlight of our relationship -- when you broke up with me, or when I killed you?\n - Buffy\n\n",
"What will your mommy sing when they find your body?\n - Drusilla\n\n",
"What would Sunnydale High do without you around to incite mayhem, chaos, and disorder?\n - Principal Snyder\n\n",
"What'd you think, I'd wake up and we'd go for tea? You tried to gut me, Blondie\n - Faith\n\n",
"What's a Slayer?\n - Riley\n\n",
"What's a little sweater-sniffing between sworn enemies?\n - Riley\n\n",
"What's the matter, Spike? Dru dump you again?\n - Buffy\n\n",
"What's this? Sitting around watching the telly while there's evil still afoot? It's not very industrious of you. I say, we go out there, and kick a little demon ass. What, can't go without your Buffy? Is that it? Too chicken? Let's find her. She is the Chosen One, after all. Come on! Vampires! Grrr! Nasty. Let's annihilate them. For justice, and for the safety of puppies, and Christmas, right? Let's fight that evil. Let's kill something. Oh, come on!\n - Spike\n\n",
"What's with the Catholic schoolgirl look? Last time I saw you, it was kimonos.\n - Angel\n\n",
"What, are you people blind? She's hangin' on by a thread. Any ninny can see that\n - Spike\n\n",
"What, you just tripped and fell on his lips?\n - Xander\n\n",
"What, you think you have some sort of special lesbi-dar or something?\n - Willow\n\n",
"What? No. I snuck in yesterday and peed in the pool\n - Jonathan\n\n",
"Whatever. They were cranky. So they're like, 'Let's lose some heads!' Ugh, that's fair. And, eh, Marie Antoinette cared about them. She was gonna' let them have cake.\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"When I say ‘I love you,’ it’s not because I want you or because I can’t have you. It has nothing to do with me. I love what you are, what you do, how you try. I’ve seen your kindness and your strength. I’ve seen the best and worst of you. And I understand with perfect clarity exactly what you are. You’re a hell of a woman. You’re the one, Buffy.\n - Spike\n\n",
"When I think that something could happen to you, it feels bad inside, like I might vomit\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"When I was younger, I used to put my chopsticks in my mouth like this, and then Buffy would chase me around the house yelling, 'I'm the Slayer, I'm going to get you!\n - Dawn\n\n",
"When are you going to get this, B? Life for a Slayer is very simple -- want... take... have\n - Faith\n\n",
"When are you two gonna' start wearing cute little matching outfits? 'Cause I'm planning to vomit.\n - Harmony\n\n",
"When you brought me here, I thought it was to kill me. Or to lock me in some mystical dungeon for all eternity here. With the torture. Instead, you go all Dumbledore on me\n - Willow\n\n",
"Where did you get that dress? This is a one-of-a-kind Todd Oldham. Do you know how much this dress cost? Is this a knock-off? This is a knock-off, isn't it? Some cheesy knock-off. This is exactly what happens when you sign these free trade agreements.\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Who knows, with any luck, they'll kill each other. Then everyone's a winner. Everyone, of course, meaning me\n - Mayor Wilkins\n\n",
"Who made you Queen of the world? Well, you're old enough to be.\n - Amy\n\n",
"Who ordered more chickens'feet? The ones we have aren't moving at all.\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"Whoa, Giles has a TV. Everybody, Giles has a TV! He's shallow like us\n - Xander\n\n",
"Why doesn't he just slit her throat, or strangle her while she's sleeping, or cut her heart out? What? I'm trying to help\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"Why don't you rip her lungs out? That might make an impression.\n - Spike\n\n",
"Why not? I killed mine. I killed their friends and their friends' children for a hundred years. I offered ugly death to everyone I met, and I did it with a song in my heart\n - Angel\n\n",
"Wiggy?\n - Kendra\n\n",
"Will, this is verging on naughty touching, here. Don't want to fall back on bad habits. Hands! Hands in new places\n - Xander\n\n",
"Willow's a witch?\n - Joyce\n\n",
"With all the rubbish people keep sticking in my head, it's a wonder that there's room for my brain.\n - Spike\n\n",
"With you being special needs boy, I figure I should stay close to home. You and Dru could always use another pair of hands\n - Angel\n\n",
"Wow, it's like, one second you were this klutzy teenager with false memories and a history of kleptomania, and then suddenly you were a hero. A hero with a much abbreviated life span\n - Anyanka\n\n",
"Yeah, I said I'll do anything. Oh, you mean, will I have sex with you? Well, yeah\n - Harmony\n\n",
"Yeah, I think you had a lot of misconceptions about college, like that anyone would be caught dead wearing that\n - Sunday\n\n",
"Yeah, I'm also a person. You can't just define me by my Slayerness. That's... something-ism\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Yeah, baby. I'm back\n - Angel\n\n",
"Yeah, just see him in a relationship. 'Hi, honey. You're in grave danger. I'll see you next month!\n - Buffy\n\n",
"Yeah, that was real manly how you shrieked and all\n - Faith\n\n",
"Yeah, that's the worst part of being hung upside-down by a vampire who wants to slit your throat: the stains.\n - Miss Calendar\n\n",
"Yeah, well, I'm not the one who wanted 'Wind Beneath My Wings' for the first dance\n - Spike\n\n",
"Yeah, well, I'm telling Mom you slayed in front of me\n - Dawn\n\n",
"Yeah, well, sometimes I like to crumble up the weetabix in the blood. Gives it a little texture\n - Spike\n\n",
"Yeah, you're the Slayer. We're, like, the Slayerettes\n - Willow\n\n",
"Yeah. Curfew-free nights of mom-and-popless hootenanny.\n - Oz\n\n",
"Yeah. I planned to get killed, come back as a vamp and bite you\n - Dawn\n\n",
"Yeah. Kinda. (looks up) I-I mean, yes. People keep... people have a tendency to go away... and, I miss them. And sometimes... I wish I could just make them stop. Going away.\n - Dawn\n\n",
"Yes, and while she may live up to the not-a-murderer requirement for enrollment, she is a troublemaker, destructive to school property and the occasional student. And her grade point average is enough to... I'm sorry, another tingle moment.\n - Principal Snyder\n\n",
"Yes, it was a gas leak, everyone. Just get some air, and a good night's rest, you know, you'll be fine. These gas things... will happen... What was it really?\n - Giles\n\n",

"You feel smothered. Trapped like an animal. Pure in its ferocity. unable to actualize the feelings within.

I will make you whole again, make you savage\n - Adam\n\n",
"You found the last known Urn of Osiris on eBay?\n - Tara\n\n",

"You know, Buffy-- sweet girl, not that bright\n - Willow\n\n",
"You know, I always loved the story of the last supper. The body and blood of Christ becoming rich red wine. I recall, as a boy though, I couldn't help but think, what would happen if you were at the last supper and you ordered the white? A nice oaky Chardonnay or a white zin. Would he make that out of his lymph or some all?\n - Caleb\n\n",

"You know, I honestly don't think there's a human word fabulous enough for me\n - Glorificus\n\n",

"You know. No kick-o, no fight-o.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"You listen to me. [Kneels in front of her] I've been alive a bit longer than you, and dead a lot longer than that. I've seen things you couldn't imagine, and done things I prefer you didn't. I don't exactly have a reputation for being a thinker. I follow my blood, which doesn't exactly rush in the direction of my brain. So I make a lot of mistakes, a lot of wrong bloody calls. A hundred plus years, and there's only one thing I've ever been sure of: you. [Buffy looks away; he reaches toward her face] Hey, look at me. I'm not asking you for anything. When I say, 'I love you,' it's not because I want you or because I can't have you. It has nothing to do with me. I love what you are, what you do, how you try. I've seen your kindness and your strength. I've seen the best and the worst of you. And I understand with perfect clarity exactly what you are. You're a hell of a woman. You're the one, Buffy.\n - Spike\n\n",

"You smell this bad when you were alive?\n - Buffy\n\n",

"You won. All right? You came in, and you killed them and you took their land. That's what conquering nations do. It's what Caesar did, and he's not going around saying, 'I came, I conquered, I felt really bad about it.\n - Spike\n\n",
"You're Buffy's Watcher. I mean, in a fired way...\n - Willow\n\n",
"You're a sheep. All you ever do is what everyone else does, just so you can say you did it first. And here I am, scrambling for your approval, when I'm way cooler than you are, 'cause I'm not a sheep. I do what I want to do, and I wear what I want to wear, and you know what? I date whoever the hell I want to date. No matter how lame he is.\n - Cordelia\n\n",
"You're always around when all this weird stuff is happening, and I know you're very strong, and you've got all those weapons. I was kind of hoping you were in a gang.\n - Cordelia\n\n",

"You're in love with a vampire? What, are you out of your mind?\n - Xander\n\n",
"You're not friends. You'll never be friends. You'll be in love till it kills you both. You'll fight, and you'll shag, and you'll hate each other until it makes you quiver, but you'll never be friends. Love isn't brains, children, it's blood -- blood screaming inside you to work its will. I may be love's bitch, but at least I'm man enough to admit it\n - Spike\n\n",

"You've got a lot to learn about men, kiddo, although I guess you proved that last night.\n - Angel\n\n",

"You... all of you... Why couldn't you be dealing drugs like normal people?\n - Principal Snyder\n\n",
"You’re not friends. You’ll never be friends. Love isn’t brains, children, it’s blood. Blood screaming inside you to work its will. I may be love’s bitch, but at least I’m man enough to admit it.\n - Spike\n\n",
"[On humans] I guess I just realized how amazingly screwed up they all are. I mean, really, really screwed up, in a monumental fashion. And they have no purpose that unites them so they just drift around, blundering through life until they die… which they… they know is coming, yet every single one of them is surprised when it happens to them. They’re incapable of thinking about what they want beyond the moment. They kill each other, which is clearly insane. And yet, here’s the thing – when it’s something that really matters, they fight. I mean, they’re lame morons for fighting, but they do. They never… never quit. So I guess I will keep fighting too.\n - Anya\n\n",
"[On life] Yes, it’s terribly simple. The good guys are always stalwart and true, the bad guys are easily distinguished by their pointy horns or black hats, and, uh, we always defeat them and save the day. No one ever dies, and everybody lives happily ever after.\n - Giles\n\n",
"[To Angel] My diary? You read my diary? That is not okay! A diary is like a person’s most private place! You don’t even know what I was writing about! ‘Hunk’ can mean a lot of things, bad things. And, when it says that your eyes are ‘penetrating’, I meant to write ‘bulging’. And ‘A’ doesn’t even stand for Angel for that matter, it stands for Achmed, a charming foreign exchange student, so that whole fantasy part has nothing to even do with you at all…\n - Buffy\n\n",
"[To Angel] We’re not friends. We never were. And I can fool Giles, and I can fool my friends, but I can’t fool myself. Or Spike, for some reason. What I want from you I can never have.\n - Buffy\n\n",
"[To Xander] It must be really hard when all your friends have, like superpowers; Slayer, werewolf, witch, vampires; and you’re, like, this little nothing.\n - Cordelia\n\n"
